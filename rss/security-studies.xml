  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Senior Kevin Guo, a computer science major, and junior Erin Hovendon, studying mechanical engineering, are on widely divergent paths at MIT. But their lives do intersect in one dimension: They share an understanding that their political science and public policy minors provide crucial perspectives on their research and future careers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Guo, the connection between computer science and policy emerged through his work at MIT's Election Data and Science Lab. “When I started, I was just looking for a place to learn how to code and do data science,” he reflects. “But what I found was this fascinating intersection where technical skills could directly shape democratic processes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hovendon is focused on sustainable methods for addressing climate change. She is currently participating in a multisemester research project at MIT's Environmental Dynamics Lab (ENDLab) developing monitoring technology for marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She believes the success of her research today and in the future depends on understanding its impact on society. Her academic track in policy provides that grounding.&amp;nbsp;“When you’re developing a new technology, you need to focus as well on how it will be applied,” she says. “This means learning about the policies required to scale it up, and about the best ways to convey the value of what you’re working on to the public.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bridging STEM and policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For both Hovendon and Guo, interdisciplinary study is proving to be a valuable platform for tangibly addressing real-world challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guo came to MIT from Andover, Massachusetts, the son of parents who specialize in semiconductors and computer science. While math and computer science were a natural track for him, Guo was also keenly interested in geopolitics. He enrolled in class 17.40 (American Foreign Policy). “It was my first engagement with MIT political science and I liked it a lot, because it dealt with historical episodes I wanted to learn more about, like World War II, the Korean War, and Vietnam,” says Guo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He followed up with a class on American Military History and on the Rise of Asia, where he found himself enrolled with graduate students and active duty U.S. military officers. “I liked attending a course with people who had unusual insights,” Guo remarks. “I also liked that these humanities classes were small seminars, and focused a lot on individual students.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From coding to elections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was in class 17.835 (Machine Learning and Data Science in Politics) that Guo first realized he could directly connect his computer science and math expertise to the humanities. “They gave us big political science datasets to analyze, which was a pretty cool application of the skills I learned in my major,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guo springboarded from this class to a three-year, undergraduate research project in the Election Data and Science Lab. “The hardest part is data collection, which I worked on for an election audit project that looked at whether there were significant differences between original vote counts and audit counts in all the states, at the precinct level,” says Guo. “We had to scrape data, raw PDFs, and create a unified dataset, standardized to our format, that we could publish.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data analysis skills he acquired in the lab have come in handy in the professional sphere in which he has begun training: investment finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The workflow is very similar: clean the data to see what you want, analyze it to see if I can find an edge, and then write some code to implement it,” he says. “The biggest difference between finance and the lab research is that the development cycle is a lot faster, where you want to act on a dataset in a few days, rather than weeks or months.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engineering environmental solutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hovendon, a native of North Carolina with a deep love for the outdoors, arrived at MIT committed “to doing something related to sustainability and having a direct application in the world around me,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, she headed toward environmental engineering, “but then I realized that pretty much every major can take a different approach to that topic,” she says. “So I ended up switching to mechanical engineering because I really enjoy the hands-on aspects of the field.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In parallel to her design and manufacturing, and mechanics and materials courses, Hovendon also immersed herself in energy and environmental policy classes. One memorable anthropology class, 21A.404 (Living through Climate Change), asked students to consider whether technological or policy solutions could be fully effective on their own for combating climate change. “It was useful to apply holistic ways of exploring human relations to the environment,” says Hovendon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hovendon brings this well-rounded perspective to her research at ENDLab in marine carbon capture and fluid dynamics. She is helping to develop verification methods for mCDR at a pilot treatment plant in California. The facility aims to remove 100 tons of carbon dioxide directly from the ocean by enhancing natural processes. Hovendon hopes to design cost-efficient monitoring systems to demonstrate the efficacy of this new technology. If scaled up, mCDR could enable oceans to store significantly more atmospheric carbon, helping cool the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Hovendon is well aware that innovation with a major impact cannot emerge on the basis of technical efficacy alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You're going to have people who think that you shouldn't be trying to replicate or interfere with a natural system, and if you're putting one of these facilities somewhere in water, then you're using public spaces and resources,” she says. “It's impossible to come up with any kind of technology, but especially any kind of climate-related technology, without first getting the public to buy into it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She recalls class 17.30J (Making Public Policy), which emphasized the importance of both economic and social analysis to the successful passage of highly impactful legislation, such as the Affordable Care Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think that breakthroughs in science and engineering should be evaluated not just through their technological prowess, but through the success of their implementation for general societal benefit,” she says. “Understanding the policy aspects is vital for improving accessibility for scientific advancements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond the dome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guo will soon set out for a career as a quantitative financial trader, and he views his political science background as essential to his success. While his expertise in data cleaning and analysis will come into play, he believes other skills will as well: “Understanding foreign policy, considering how U.S. policy impacts other places, that's actually very important in finance,” he explains. “Macroeconomic changes and politics affect trading volatility and markets in general, so it's very important to understand what's going on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With one year to go, Hovendon is contemplating graduate school in mechanical engineering, perhaps designing renewable energy technologies. “I just really hope that I'm working on something I'm genuinely passionate about, something that has a broader purpose,” she says. “In terms of politics and technology, I also hope that at least some government research and development will still go to climate work, because I'm sure there will be an urgent need for it.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Faith Brooks, a graduate student in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mit.whoi.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;MIT-WHOI Joint Program&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;has had a clear dream since the age of 4: to become a pilot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At around 8 years old, my neighbor knew I wanted to fly and showed me pictures of her dad landing a jet on an aircraft carrier, and I was immediately captivated,” says Brooks. Further inspired by her grandfather’s experience in the U.S. Navy (USN), and owing to a lifelong fascination with aviation, she knew nothing would stand in her way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brooks explored several different paths to becoming a pilot, but she says one conversation with her longtime mentor, Capt. Matt Skone, USN (Ret.), changed the trajectory of her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He asked if I had heard of the Naval Academy,” she recalls. “At the time, I hadn’t … I immediately knew that that was where I wanted to go, and everything else I learned about United States Naval Academy (USNA) reinforced that for me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her “firstie” (senior) year at the USNA, Brooks was selected to go to Pensacola, Florida, and train to become a naval pilot as a student naval aviator, taking her one step closer to her dream. The USNA also helped guide her path to MIT. Her journey to joining the MIT-WHOI Joint Program began with the USNA’s professional knowledge curriculum, where she read about retired Capt. Wendy Lawrence SM ’88, a naval aviator and astronaut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reading her bio prompted me to&amp;nbsp;look into&amp;nbsp;the program, and it sounded like the perfect program for me — where else could you get a better education in ocean engineering than MIT and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution [WHOI]?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the MIT-WHOI Joint Program, Brooks is researching the impact of coastal pond breaching on preventing and mitigating harmful algal blooms. Her work focuses on the biannual mechanical breaching of Nantucket’s Sesachacha Pond to the ocean and the resultant impact on the pond’s water quality. This practice aims to improve water quality and mitigate harmful algal blooms (HABs), especially in summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breaching in coastal ponds is a process that was initially used to enhance salinity for herring and shellfish habitats, but has since shifted to address water quality concerns. Traditionally, an excavator creates a breach in the pond, which naturally closes within one to five days, influenced by sediment transport and weather conditions. High winds and waves can accelerate sediment movement, limiting ocean water exchange and potentially increasing eutrophication, where excessive nutrients lead to dense plant growth and depletion of oxygen. In brackish water environments, harmful algal blooms are often driven by elevated nitrogen levels and higher temperatures, with higher nitrogen concentrating leading to more frequent and severe blooms as temperatures rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nantucket Natural Resources Department (NRD) has been collaborating with local homeowners to investigate the pond breaching process. Existing data are mainly anecdotal evidence and NRD’s monthly sampling since 2022, which has not shown the expected decrease in eutrophication. Brooks’ research will focus on data before, during, and after the breach at two pond sites to assess water changes to evaluate its effectiveness in improving water quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Brooks isn’t knee-deep in the waters of the Sesachacha or training with her MIT Triathlon team, she takes additional opportunities to further her education. Last year, Brooks participated in the MIT-Portugal Marine Robotics Summer School in Faial, Azores, in Portugal, and immersed herself in a combination of a hands-on design projects and lectures on a variety of topics related to oceanography, engineering, and marine robotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My favorite part of the program was how interdisciplinary it was. We had a combination of mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, computer scientists, marine biologists, and oceanographers, and we had teams that included each of these specialties,” she says. “Our project involved designing a lander equipped with an underwater camera connected to a surface buoy that would transmit the footage. Having worked in mostly just engineering teams previously, it was a great experience to work with a more diverse group and I gained a much better understanding of how to design instruments and systems in accordance with what the marine biologists need.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brooks also earned her Part 107 Small Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) license to operate the lab’s drone with a multispectral camera for her upcoming fieldwork. When she graduates from the MIT-WHOI Joint Program next September, she’ll report to the Naval Aviation Schools Command in Pensacola, Florida, to begin flight training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she says she’ll miss Boston’s charm and history, as well as the Shining Sea Bikeway on crisp fall days in Woods Hole, Brooks is looking forward to putting her uniform back on, and starting her naval career and flight school. The time Brooks has spent at MIT will support her in these future endeavors. She advises others interested in a similar path to focus on research within their areas of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The biggest lesson that I’ve learned from both research theses is that any research project will change over time, and it’s often a good idea to take a step back and look at how your work fits into the larger picture,” she says. “I couldn’t recommend doing research more; it’s such a great opportunity to dig into something that you’re interested in, and is also very fulfilling.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Stopping the bomb</title>

  <description><![CDATA[Political science PhD student Kunal Singh identifies a suite of strategies states use to prevent other nations from developing nuclear weapons.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;“The question behind my doctoral research is simple,” says Kunal Singh, an MIT political science graduate student in his final year of studies. “When one country learns that another country is trying to make a nuclear weapon, what options does it have to stop the other country from achieving that goal?” While the query may be straightforward, answers are anything but, especially at a moment when some nations appear increasingly tempted by the nuclear option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the Middle East to India and Pakistan, and from the Korean peninsula to Taiwan, Singh has been developing a typology of counterproliferation strategies based on historical cases and to some degree on emergent events. His aim is to clarify what states can do “to stop the bomb before it is made.” Singh’s interviews with top security officials and military personnel involved in designing and executing these strategies have illuminated tense episodes in the past 75 years or so when states have jockeyed to enter the elite atomic club. His insights might upend some of the binary thinking that dominates the field of nuclear security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ultimately, I’d like my work to help decision-makers predict counterproliferation strategy, and draw lessons from it on how to shield their own citizens and economies from the impact of these strategies,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types of nonproliferation tactics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Oct. 7, 2023, Singh awoke to air raid sirens in Jerusalem, where he was conducting interviews, and discovered Israel was under attack. He was airlifted to safety back to the United States, having borne witness to the start of a regional war that “now has become relevant to my research,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before his hasty departure, Singh was investigating two singular episodes where military force was deployed to advance nonproliferation goals: Israel’s airstrikes against nuclear reactors in 1981 in Iraq, and in 2007 in Syria. To date, these have been the only major attacks on nuclear facilities outside of an active war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I spoke with Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who ordered the strike in Syria, and with the commander of the Israeli Air Force who planned the Iraq airstrike, as well as with other members of the security bureaucracy,” says Singh. “Israel feels a large degree of threat because it is a very small country surrounded by hostile powers, so it takes a military route to stop another state from acquiring nuclear weapons,” says Singh. But, he notes, “most of the states which are not in this predicament generally resort to diplomatic methods first, and threaten violence only as a last resort.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singh defines the military response by Israel as “kinetic reversion,” one of five types of counterproliferation strategies he has identified. Another is “military coercion,” where a state threatens the use of military force or uses moderate force to demonstrate its commitment to preventing the pursuit of the bomb. States can also use diplomatic and economic leverage over the proliferant to persuade it to drop its nuclear program, what Singh calls “diplomatic inhibition.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One form this strategy takes is when one country agrees to give up its program in return for the other doing the same. Another form involves “placing sanctions on a country and excluding them from the world economy, until the country rolls back its program — a strategy the U.S. has employed against Iran, North Korea, Libya, and Pakistan,” says Singh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India was rumored to have embraced military tactics. “I had always read about the claim that India was ready to attack the Pakistani uranium enrichment plant in Kahuta, and that planes were called off at the last minute,” Singh says. “But in interview after interview I found this was not the case, and I discovered that many written accounts of this episode had been completely blown up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another strategy, “pooled prevention,” nations can band together to apply economic, diplomatic, and military pressure on a potential proliferator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singh notes that diplomatic inhibition, pooled prevention, and military coercion have succeeded, historically. “In 2003, Libya gave up its nuclear weapons program completely after the U.S. and U.K. placed sanctions on it, and many states do not even start a nuclear weapons program because they anticipate an attack or a sanction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final strategy Singh defines is “accommodation,” where one or more states decide not to take action against nuclear weapon development. The United States arrived at this strategy when China began its nuclear program — after first considering and rejecting military attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singh hopes that his five kinds of strategies challenge a “binary trap” that most academics in the field fall into. “They think of counterproliferation either as military attack or no military attack, economic sanctions or no sanctions, and so they miss out on the spectrum of behaviors, and how fluid they can be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From journalism to security studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singh grew up in Varanasi, a Hindu holy city in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Frequent terrorist attacks throughout India, and some inside his city’s temples, made a deep impression on him during his childhood, he says. A math and science talent, he attended the Indian Institute of Technology, majoring in metallurgical and materials engineering. After a brief stint with a management consulting firm, after college, he landed a job at a think tank, the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I moved to New Delhi, I suddenly saw a world which I didn’t know existed,” Singh recalls. “I began meeting people for an evening round of discussions and began reading voraciously: books, editorial and opinion pages in newspapers, and looking for a greater sense of purpose and meaning in my work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His widening interests led to a job as staff writer, first at &lt;em&gt;Mint,&lt;/em&gt; a business newspaper, and then to the &lt;em&gt;Hindustan Times,&lt;/em&gt; working on both papers’ editorial pages. “This was where most of my intellectual development happened,” says Singh. “I made social connections, and many of them grew more towards the academics in the security field.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing about a nuclear security question one day, Singh reached out to an expert in the United States: Vipin Narang, the Frank Stanton Professor of Nuclear Security and Political Science at MIT. Over time, Narang helped Singh realize that the kind of questions Singh hoped to answer “lay more in the academic than in the journalistic domain,” recounts Singh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, he headed to MIT and began a doctoral program focused on security studies and international relations. In his dissertation, “Nipping the Atom in the Bud: Strategies of Counterproliferation and How States Choose Among Them,” Singh hopes to move beyond a classic, academic debate: that nuclear weapons are either very destabilizing, or very stabilizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some argue that there is stability in the world because two states armed with nuclear weapons will avoid nuclear war, because they understand nobody will win a nuclear war,” explains Singh. “If this view is true, then we shouldn’t be alarmed by the proliferation of these weapons.” But “the counterargument is that there will always be an off chance someone will use these weapons, and so states should “try to use all their military and economic might to prevent another state from gaining nuclear weapons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, neither extreme view governs in the real world. “The main takeaway from my research is that states are obviously concerned when some other country tries to make nuclear weapons, but they are not so concerned that in order to prevent a future destabilizing event, they are ready to destabilize the world as of now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the final throes of writing his thesis and preparing for life as an academic, Singh remains alert to the parlous state of affairs in the Middle East and elsewhere. “I keep following events, knowing that something may prove relevant to my research,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the tense times and the often dark implications of his subject matter, Singh has found an optimal mode of blowing off steam: a daily badminton match. He and his wife also “binge watch either a spy thrill or a murder mystery every Saturday,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world both increasingly interconnected and increasingly threatened by regional conflicts, Singh believes, “there is still much to be discovered about how the world thinks about nuclear weapons, including what the impacts of nuclear weapons use might be,” he says. “I’d like to help shine a light on those new things, and broaden our understanding of nuclear weapons and the politics of nuclear security.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;div id="WACViewPanel_ClipboardElement" spellcheck="false" tabindex="0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="610166423" paraeid="{4d196566-e2ac-468c-80ab-2321a9768111}{37}"&gt;Gene Keselman wears a lot of hats. He is a lecturer at the &lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MIT Sloan School of Management&lt;/a&gt;, the executive director of &lt;a href="https://mix.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mission Innovation Experimental&lt;/a&gt; (MIx), and managing director of MIT’s venture studio, &lt;a href="http://protoventures.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Proto Ventures&lt;/a&gt;. Colonel in the Air Force Reserves at the Pentagon, board director, and startup leader are only a few of the titles and leadership positions Keselman has held. Now in his seventh year at MIT, his work as an innovator will impact the Institute for years to come.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p paraid="610166423" paraeid="{4d196566-e2ac-468c-80ab-2321a9768111}{37}"&gt;Keselman and his family are refugees from the Soviet Union. To say that the United States opened its arms and took care of his family is something Keselman calls “an understatement.” Growing up, he felt both gratitude and the need to give back to the country that took in his family. Because of this, Keselman joined the U.S. Air Force after college. Originally, he thought he would spend a few years in the Air Force, earn money to attend graduate school, and leave. Instead, he found a sense of belonging in the military lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p paraid="610166423" paraeid="{4d196566-e2ac-468c-80ab-2321a9768111}{37}"&gt;Early on, Keselman was a nuclear operations officer for four years, watching over nuclear weapons in Wyoming; while it was not a glamorous job, it was a strategically important one. He then joined the intelligence community in Washington, working on special programs for space. Next, he became an acquisition and innovation generalist inside the Air Force, working his way up to the rank of colonel, working on an innovation team at the Pentagon. Meanwhile, Keselman started exploring what his nonmilitary entrepreneurial life could look like. He left active duty after 12 years, entered the reserves, and began his relationship with MIT as an MBA student at the MIT Sloan School of Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="WACViewPanel_ClipboardElement" spellcheck="false" tabindex="0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="507190417" paraeid="{1a43bea0-058c-4add-829f-82763b93072d}{14}"&gt;At MIT Sloan, Keselman met Fiona Murray, associate dean of innovation and inclusion, who took an interest in Keselman’s experience. When the position of executive director of the Innovation Initiative (a program launched by then-President L. Rafael Reif) became available, Murray and &lt;a href="https://mitnano.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MIT.nano&lt;/a&gt; Director Vladimir Bulovic hired Keselman and became his managers and main collaborators. While he was unsure that he would be a natural inside academia, Keselman credits Murray and Bulovic with seeing that his skill set from working with the Department of Defense (DoD) and in the military could translate and be useful in academia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="WACViewPanel_ClipboardElement" spellcheck="false" tabindex="0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1126805665" paraeid="{1a43bea0-058c-4add-829f-82763b93072d}{183}"&gt;As a military officer, Keselman focused on process, innovation, leadership, and team building — tools he found useful in his new position. Over the next five years at MIT — a place, he admits, that was already at the forefront of innovation — he ran and created programs that augment how the Institute’s cutting-edge research is shared with the world. When the Innovation Initiative became the &lt;a href="http://innovation.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Office of Innovation&lt;/a&gt;, Keselman handed off executive duties to his deputy. Today, he oversees two programs. The first, MIx, focuses on national security innovation, defense technology, and dual-use (creating a commercial product and a capability for the government or defense). The other, Proto Ventures, is centered around venture building and translation of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="WACViewPanel_ClipboardElement" spellcheck="false" tabindex="0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1582171075" paraeid="{848f9ebd-1330-48c5-8d6d-a467968ddf4a}{23}"&gt;With MIx and Proto Ventures established, it was time to build a teaching component for students interested in working for a startup that the government might want to partner with and learn from. Keselman becoming a lecturer at Sloan seemed like a clear next step. What started as a hackathon for MIT Air Force, Army, and Navy ROTC students to introduce the special operations community to those who were planning to become military officers turned into a class open to all undergrad and graduate students. Keselman co-teaches &lt;a href="https://mix.mit.edu/opportunities/engineering-innovation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;innovation engineering for global security systems&lt;/a&gt;, a design/build class in collaboration with U.S. Special Operations Command, where students learn to build innovative solutions in response to global security problems. Students who do not plan to work for the government enroll because of their desire to work on the most interesting — and difficult — problems in the world. Enrollment in these courses sometimes changes the career trajectory of students who decide they would like to work on national security-related problems in the future. While teaching was not an initial part of his plan, the opportunity to teach has become one of his joys.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="WACViewPanel_ClipboardElement" spellcheck="false" tabindex="0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1681813811" paraeid="{848f9ebd-1330-48c5-8d6d-a467968ddf4a}{136}"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soundbytes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1727886703" paraeid="{848f9ebd-1330-48c5-8d6d-a467968ddf4a}{142}"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What project brings you the most pride?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="287711229" paraeid="{848f9ebd-1330-48c5-8d6d-a467968ddf4a}{154}"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keselman:&lt;/strong&gt; Proto Ventures is probably what I will look back on that will have made the most impact on MIT. I’m proud that I've continued to sustain it. Building a venture studio inside MIT is unique and is not replicated anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="WACViewPanel_ClipboardElement" spellcheck="false" tabindex="0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1638345505" paraeid="{848f9ebd-1330-48c5-8d6d-a467968ddf4a}{202}"&gt;I’m also really proud of our work with &lt;a href="https://www.nato.int" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.diana.nato.int" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Defence &lt;/a&gt;Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA). DIANA is NATO’s effort to start its own accelerator program for startups to encourage them to work on solving national security questions in their country, based on the model at MIT. We built the curriculum, and I’ve taught it to DIANA startups in places including Italy, Poland, Denmark, and Estonia. The fact that NATO recognized that we need to promote access to startups and that there is a need to create an accelerator network is amazing. When it started, MIT was probably one of the only places teaching dual-use in the country. The fact that I got to take this curriculum and build it to scale in 32 countries and hundreds of startups is really rewarding.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="WACViewPanel_ClipboardElement" spellcheck="false" tabindex="0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1806168315" paraeid="{cdd748d4-ae0e-4e11-822c-c542c37781c9}{117}"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;In recognition of their service to our country, MIT actively seeks to recruit and employ veterans throughout its workforce. As a reservist, how does MIT support the time you take away from the Institute to fulfill your duties?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="429449854" paraeid="{cdd748d4-ae0e-4e11-822c-c542c37781c9}{127}"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keselman:&lt;/strong&gt; MIT has a long history with the military, especially back in WWII times. With that comes a deep history of supporting the military. When I came to MIT I found a welcoming community that enables me to run centers, teach, and have students work on problems brought to us by the government. The magical thing about MIT is an openness to collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="904050973" paraeid="{cdd748d4-ae0e-4e11-822c-c542c37781c9}{238}"&gt;[At MIT,] Being an officer in the reserves is seen as a benefit, not a distraction. No one says, “He's gone again for his military duties at the Pentagon. He's not doing his work.” Instead, my work is viewed as an advantage for the Institute. MIT is a special place for the veteran and military community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="WACViewPanel_ClipboardElement" spellcheck="false" tabindex="0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="866435518" paraeid="{aa1d9d45-7ac8-4658-a0ea-c3011ef3245f}{49}"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;A &lt;a href="https://iceo.mit.edu/employee-resource-groups/veterans-and-military-erg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Veteran and Military Employee Resource Group (ERG)&lt;/a&gt; was recently launched at MIT. What do you hope will come from the ERG?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1400388239" paraeid="{aa1d9d45-7ac8-4658-a0ea-c3011ef3245f}{74}"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keselman:&lt;/strong&gt; The ERG once again underscores the uniqueness of MIT. Recruiter Nicolette Clifford from Human Resources and I had the idea for the group, but I thought, “Would anyone want this?” The reception from MIT Human Resources was positive and reinforcing. To put veterans and military into a supported group and make them feel like they have a home is amazing. I was blown away by it. We don’t usually get this kind of treatment. People thank us for our service, but then move on. It sends a message that MIT is a very friendly place for veterans. It also shows that MIT supports the people that defend our national security and support our way of life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For graduate students Kelsey Pittman and Jacqueline Orr, service in the U.S. military led to their interest in engineering, and to the MIT Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pittman’s first exposure to the military and engineering took place during her undergraduate years at the United States Military Academy West Point.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I remember back in high school, my dad kind of planted the seed of going to a military academy,” says Pittman.&amp;nbsp; While she admitted to feeling overwhelmed about the prospect of going to college at that time, her father’s rationale for West Point resonated with her.&amp;nbsp;“I’m a structured person and I like routine,” she says — two aspects the environment at West Point provides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Pittman’s father hadn’t attended a military academy or served in the military, he was a member of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for 25 years, and her family connections provided Pittman with valuable perspectives on West Point. It ended up being the only undergraduate program Pittman applied to. “I just wanted to be part of something bigger than myself, and all the opportunity West Point could give was pretty incredible,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pittman’s parents also recognized her passion for design and encouraged her to consider a career in architecture. Although West Point didn’t offer an architecture program, she chose civil engineering, a field that allowed her to combine her love of math and design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After graduating, she was commissioned as an engineer officer in the U.S. Army and has served for over seven years. She is now pursuing her graduate education at MIT in structural engineering with advisor John Ochsendorf, professor of civil and environmental engineering and architecture. Pittman is researching Gothic-style infrastructure for its masonry resiliency and stability over time, specifically Beauvais Cathedral and its structural safety. One of the reasons she chose to pursue her graduate studies in CEE was the department’s openness to explore diverse research opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was really drawn to the ability to carve my own research niche and have the freedom to figure out what really interests me, rather than being presented with a limited set of research options,” says Pittman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After receiving her master’s degree, Pittman will return to West Point as a faculty member for three years and then continue her service obligation in the Army. She credits her mentors at West Point as being instrumental in her academic and professional journey and hopes to play a role in shaping the lives of future generations of cadets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have incredible mentors that I still talk to, and I really wanted to be able to go back and give back to a place, and the people that gave me so much support and room to grow and find my passion. Every step has been made in my career so far to get back to West Point and teach in the civil engineering department.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pittman also acknowledges and values the Army for the opportunities it has provided her, particularly the chance to pursue her master’s degree at MIT, the relationships she has built along the way and career path it has opened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve enjoyed getting to know the soldiers from all over the world and seeing them in this environment where you might give each other a hard time, but at the end of the day you know that you have each other’s back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacqueline Orr, also a U.S. Military Academy&amp;nbsp;graduate, is currently pursuing a master’s degree in structural engineering under the guidance of Josephine Carstensen, the Gilbert W. Winslow Career Development Associate Professor&amp;nbsp;for Civil and Environmental Engineering. Inspired by her father to pursue a strong foundation in math and science, she earned a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering. After graduation, she fulfilled her service obligation and served for six years as a member of the 173rd Airborne Brigade based in Vicenza, Italy — a unit renowned for its history, combat readiness, and crucial part of the Army’s joint integration with NATO.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on her experience, Orr says, “Airborne units, like many great units in the Army, require overcoming an additional litmus test — in this case, conquering the fear of jumping from high-performance aircraft, hundreds of feet above the ground."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she enjoyed her time in the Army, her experiences ultimately led her to pursue a career more closely aligned with her passion for engineering. “When I was studying mechanical engineering, I developed a strong interest in structures during my senior design project,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She particularly enjoyed learning how to model structures and analyze how they respond to various forces. She felt that the traditional methods taught in her classes lacked an optimization component, which sparked her interest in topology optimization as a potential solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This desire to further explore topology optimization — specifically in relation to structures and their behavior under different forces — motivated her to seek graduate programs specializing in this field. Orr applied for and was awarded a Department of Defense (DoD) SMART Scholarship that brought her to MIT to study topology optimization in the Carstensen Lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“MIT was the ideal institution to pursue this research due to Professor Carstensen’s expertise and innovative work happening in the civil and environmental engineering department,” Orr says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Orr plans to apply the knowledge gained at MIT to a research-oriented career as part of her obligation as a DoD SMART Scholar.&amp;nbsp;But for now, she’s adjusting to life as a graduate student. “I’m really enjoying my classes and getting to know people in the lab — it’s been an amazing experience,” she adds.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Connecting the US Coast Guard to MIT Sloan</title>

  <description><![CDATA[For the past 50 years, the Coast Guard has nominated a senior officer to apply to the MIT Sloan Fellows MBA program. “When you leave MIT Sloan, you want to change the world,” says one alumnus.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Andrew Husband | MIT Sloan School of Management</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Jim Ellis II SM ’80 first learned about a special opportunity for members of the U.S. Coast Guard while stationed in Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My commander had received a notice from headquarters about this opportunity. They were asking for recommendations for an officer who might be interested,” says Ellis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opportunity in question was the MIT Sloan Fellows program, today known as the &lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/mit-sloan-fellows-mba-program/introduce-yourself" target="_blank"&gt;MIT Sloan Fellows MBA (SFMBA) program&lt;/a&gt;. Every year for 50 years, the Coast Guard has nominated a service member to apply to the program. Fifty Sloan Fellows and two Management of Technology participants have graduated since 1976, and the 53rd student is currently enrolled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his tour nearly over, Ellis followed his commander’s recommendation to apply. The Coast Guard nominated him and his application to MIT Sloan School of Management was accepted. In 1980, Ellis became the fifth-ever Coast Guard Sloan Fellow to graduate due to the special arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My experience at MIT Sloan has been instrumental throughout my entire career,” says Ellis, who, with his wife Margaret Brady, designated half of their bequest to support graduate fellowships through the &lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/alumni/mit-sloan-veterans-fund" title="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/alumni/mit-sloan-veterans-fund" data-outlook-id="d209953c-3195-4cb7-b897-c64f2f3d379f"&gt;MIT Sloan Veterans Fund&lt;/a&gt; and half to establish the &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/06/27/1074015/james-ellis-ii-sm-80-and-margaret-brady/" target="_blank" title="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/06/27/1074015/james-ellis-ii-sm-80-and-margaret-brady/" data-outlook-id="6ec4e1f7-3e19-4e28-b5ad-677f7694571a"&gt;Ellis/Brady Family Fund&lt;/a&gt; to support the MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The success of the people who have been through the program is a testament to why the Coast Guard continues the program,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The desire to change the world&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout its 163-year history, MIT has maintained strong relationships with the U.S. military through programs like the MIT Reserve Officers' Training Corps, the 2N Graduate Program in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-standing collaboration between MIT Sloan and the Coast Guard adds to this history. According to &lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/staff/directory/johanna-hising-difabio" target="_blank"&gt;Johanna Hising DiFabio&lt;/a&gt;, assistant dean for executive degree programs at MIT Sloan, it demonstrates the Coast Guard’s dedication to leadership development, as well as the unique benefits MIT Sloan has to offer service members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is especially evident in the careers of the 52 Coast Guard Sloan Fellow alumni, many of whom the program often invites to speak to current students. “It is inspiring to hear our alumni reflect on how this education has significantly influenced their careers and the considerable impact they have had on the Coast Guard and the global community,” says DiFabio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Captain Anne O’Connell MBA ’19 says, “It is very rewarding to be able to pay it back, to look for those officers coming up behind you who should absolutely be offered the same opportunities, and to help them chart that course. I think it's hugely important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most notable Coast Guard Sloan Fellows is Retired Admiral Thad Allen SM ’89, who served as commandant of the Coast Guard from 2006 to 2010. One of the service’s youngest-ever flag officers, Allen is a figure beloved by current and former guardsmen. As commandant, he embraced new digital technologies, championed further arctic exploration, and solidified relations with the other armed services, federal partners, and private industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you leave MIT Sloan, you want to change the world,” says Allen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by his father, who enlisted after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Allen attended the U.S. Coast Guard Academy and subsequently held various commands at sea and ashore during a career spanning four decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years before the end of his second decade, Allen learned about the Sloan Fellows Program through a service-wide solicitation. “The people I worked for believed this would be a great opportunity, and that it would match with my skill set,” says Allen. With the guidance of his senior captains, he applied to MIT Sloan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen matriculated with a cohort whose members included Carly Fiorina SM ’89, former CEO of Hewlett-Packard; Daniel Hesse SM ’89, former CEO of Sprint; and Robert Malone SM ’89, former chair and president of BP America. Though he initially felt a sharp disconnect between his national service experience and their global private sector knowledge, Allen realized everyone in the cohort were becoming his peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong bonds with global perspectives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Allen, many of the Coast Guard Sloan Fellows acknowledge just how powerful their cohorts were when they matriculated, as well as how influential they have remained since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have classmates with giant perspectives and unique expertise in places all over the world. It’s remarkable,” says Retired Commander Catherine Kang MBA ’06, who served as deputy of financial transformation for Allen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of SFMBA candidates come to Cambridge from around the world. For example, the 2023–24 cohort comprised 76 percent international citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Coast Guard Sloan Fellows with decades of domestic experience, their cohort’s global perspectives are as novel as they are informative. As Retired Captain Gregory Sanial SM ’07 explains, “We had students from 30 to 40 different countries, and I had the opportunity to learn a lot about different parts of the world and open up my mind to many different experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Coast Guard, Sanial pursued a doctoral degree in organizational leadership and a career in higher education that, professionally, has kept him stateside. Yet the bonds he built at MIT Sloan remain just as strong and as international as they were when he first arrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Coast Guard Sloan Fellows attribute this to the program’s focus on cooperation and social events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What impressed me most when I first got there were the team-building exercises, which made a difference in getting a group of diverse people to really gel and work together,” says Retired Captain Lisa Festa SM ’92, SM ’99. “MIT Sloan takes the time at the beginning to invest in you and to make sure you know the people you’re going through school with for the next year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most recent Coast Guard Sloan Fellow alumnus, Commander Mark Ketchum MBA ’24, says his cohort’s connections are still fresh, but he believes they will last a lifetime. Considering the testimonies of his predecessors, this may very well be the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My cohort made me stronger, and I would like to think that I imparted my strengths onto my classmates,” says Ketchum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big challenges with high impacts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before earning the Coast Guard’s nomination and an acceptance letter from the SFMBA program, potential Sloan Fellows have already served in various leadership positions. Once they graduate, the recognition and distinction that comes with an MIT Sloan degree is quick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, too, are the more challenging leadership tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After graduation, Allen served as deputy program manager for the Coast Guard’s shipbuilding program at the behest of the then-commandant. “For the agency head to say, ‘This is a bad problem, so I’m picking the next graduate from MIT Sloan,’ is indicative of the program’s cachet value,” he says. Allen then served in the office of budget and programs, a challenging and rewarding post that has become a hub for Coast Guard Sloan Fellows past, present, and future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Rear Admiral Jason Tama MBA ’11 and Captain Brian Erickson MBA ’21, both of whom credit the office with introducing them to the vigorous work ethic necessary for both obtaining an MIT Sloan education and for becoming an effective leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Never in a thousand years would I have gone on the resource management path until a mentor told me it would be one of the most challenging and high-impact things I could do,” says Tama. “You can never be fully prepared for the Sloan Fellows experience, but it can and will change you for the better. It changed the way I approach problems and challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I owe MIT for the senior-level opportunities I’ve had in this organization, and I will probably owe them for some of the opportunities I may get in the future,” adds Erickson. “You should never, ever say no to this opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the early cohorts of Ellis, Allen, and Festa, to more recent alumni like O’Connell, Kang, and Ketchum, Coast Guard Sloan Fellows from the past half-century echo Erickson and Tama’s sentiments when asked about how MIT Sloan has changed them. Words like “challenge,” “opportunity,” and “impact” are used often and with purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They believe joining the SFMBA program as up-and-coming senior leaders is an incredible opportunity for the individual and the Coast Guard, as well as the MIT community and the world at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am excited to see this tradition carry on,” says Tama. “I hope others who are considering it can see the potential and the value, not only for themselves, but for the Coast Guard as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Participation by U.S. Coast Guard members in this highlight of prior MIT Sloan Fellows is not intended as, and does not constitute an endorsement of, the MIT Sloan Fellows MBA program or MIT by either the Department of Homeland Security or the U.S. Coast Guard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT’s Security Studies Program has received a $45 million gift from The Stanton Foundation to expand its leading work on the vital issue of global nuclear security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The support will allow the program to create a new center on the topic while extending and enhancing research, teaching, and policy outreach in an area where the Institute is a longstanding leader with wide-ranging faculty expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are on the cusp of a new and more&amp;nbsp;dangerous nuclear age, with the modernization and expansion of nuclear arsenals, the collapse of arms control agreements, continued proliferation challenges, and the impact of new and emerging technologies on how states will manage their arsenals,” says M. Taylor Fravel, director of the Security Studies Program. “This new center will help us address these new challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Fravel adds, “This has been an area of expertise within MIT and the Security Studies Program for almost five decades. We are enormously appreciative of The Stanton Foundation’s confidence in us to carry this vital work forward.” The Security Studies Program is also part of MIT’s Center for International Studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Stanton Foundation’s extraordinary gift capitalizes on MIT’s deep, longstanding strength in nuclear policy research,” says MIT President Sally A. Kornbluth. “With this new investment, MIT can lead the way in advancing evidence-based nuclear policy in the best interest of our nation and the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Stanton Foundation funding will enable the center to create three fellowships for junior scholars in nuclear security, hire new senior researchers, organize workshops and conferences, host international fellows, provide support for MIT faculty research, and seed other new projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“First, it will help advance policy-relevant research on all key challenges related to nuclear security that bear on this new and potentially more dangerous nuclear era,” says Fravel, who is also the Arthur and Ruth Sloan Professor in MIT’s Department of Political Science. “Second, it will help the next generation of thought leaders pursue their own research to help mitigate these problems. So, while there is a huge set of challenges, with the center we will have new resources to address them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vipin Narang, the Frank Stanton Professor of Nuclear Security and Political Science at MIT, will serve as the center’s first director. Narang recently returned to MIT after a two-and-a-half-year public service leave at the U.S. Department of Defense, where his last position was acting assistant secretary of defense for space policy, a role that included oversight of missile defense, countering weapons of mass destruction, and nuclear deterrence policy, among other topics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am thrilled to return to MIT and help launch this historic center, which will hopefully become a central pillar in the world’s study and practice of nuclear security, at this crucial time in the resurgence of nuclear threats,” Narang says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Stanton Foundation was established by Frank Stanton, president of the broadcaster CBS from 1946 to 1971. Stanton’s involvement with nuclear issues began with his appointment to a committee convened by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1954 to develop the first comprehensive plan for the survival of the U.S. following a nuclear attack. Stanton had lead responsibility for developing a plan for national and international communication in the aftermath of a nuclear incident. The foundation has focused most of its philanthropy on nuclear security and on sustaining free speech rights while bolstering the spread of accurate civic information. It also supports work on canine health and welfare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Security Studies Program has roots extending to 1976, when it was first established as the Defense and Arms Control Study Program, before changing its name in the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s always been an area where we’ve maintained excellence, especially with respect to the very core questions of how to bring about deterrence and stability, and how to counter the challenge of proliferation,” Fravel says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fravel emphasizes that the new center will draw on expertise from across the Institute. MIT has an array of nuclear weapons experts across its departments, labs, and centers, including SSP, the Department of Political Science, the Center for International Studies, and the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering. Over the years, explains Fravel, a special feature of the program has been the integration&amp;nbsp;of technical and political analysis of national and international security problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We look forward to leveraging all the expertise at MIT to help mitigate future nuclear risks,” Fravel says.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The start and finish of a degree program are pivotal moments in the lives of MIT's graduate students. In her first three years in MIT’s Department of Political Science, professor Mariya Grinberg’s mentorship has helped numerous students start their graduate journeys with confidence and direction. Nuh Gedik, who joined the Department of Physics in 2008, looks to the finish line: he finds joy in seeing his students reach personal and professional success at the end of their PhDs. Both were recently honored as “Committed to Caring” for their support of graduate students.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mariya Grinberg: Commitment to intellectual growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When Mariya Grinberg joined the MIT Security Studies Program as a faculty member in 2021, the department was in a state of flux. The Covid-19 pandemic was in full swing, several core faculty members were nearing retirement, and the program had welcomed the largest cohort of PhD students in its history. As Grinberg entered the community, she embraced these challenges, meeting and exceeding her expected duties as an advisor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In her role as assistant professor of political science, Grinberg’s research interests center on the question of how time and uncertainty shape the strategic decisions of states, focusing on economic statecraft, military planning, and questions of state sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As a junior faculty member, Grinberg shoulders one of the largest advising loads in the department. Despite this, multiple nominators praised Grinberg for her prompt and discerning feedback. Students note her efforts in reading through and commenting on many rounds of paper drafts, supplemented by hour-long brainstorming sessions at her whiteboard. “It's rare that someone can become both your most incisive critic and staunchest advocate,” a nominator noted. “I never took it for granted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Throughout these sessions, Grinberg delivers her advice with both confidence and empathy. One nominator shared how meetings put them at ease: “Normally, I am quite anxious about meeting with faculty, but I never felt that way during my meetings with Mariya.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Grinberg believes that failure is an integral part of the learning process and encourages her students to embrace and learn from setbacks. She acknowledges that the pressure to accomplish tasks within time constraints often leaves little room for failure, which can lead to decision paralysis. Grinberg reassures her students that investing time in a dissertation idea, even if it turns out to be non-viable, is not time wasted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When asked about her philosophy on mentorship, Grinberg emphasizes that the advice of mentors is just that — advice. It represents their best effort to steer students in what they perceive to be a fruitful direction, but it does not mean the advice is invariably correct. Grinberg encourages students to critically evaluate any feedback and make their own judgments that may not align with their advisor's thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Grinberg shares a concept she first learned from a creative writing professor: “When someone tells you there is something wrong with your work, 90 percent of the time they are right. When someone tells you how to fix it, 90 percent of the time they are wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nuh Gedik: Mentoring the next generation of scientists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Gedik is the Donner Professor of Physics at MIT. His group investigates quantum materials by using advanced optical and electron-based spectroscopies. Gedik employs these techniques to study topological insulators, high-temperature superconductors, and atomically layered materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When asked about what keeps him motivated, Gedik says that he is driven by the professional development of his students. Gedik prioritizes the growth of his students above all else, and believes that academic output follows naturally with personal and professional growth. One nominator shared one of Gedik’s favorite sayings: “Finding a job for you is my job.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As a result of this mindset, the alumni of Gedik’s group have achieved spectacular professional success, including members who are now faculty at top universities such as Stanford, Harvard, and Columbia universities. Several group members are also in leadership roles at companies like Intel, Meta, or ASML.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Alongside his academic pursuits, Gedik is deeply committed to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion within his research group and the broader academic community. He dedicates regular portions of the weekly group meetings to discussing literature and practices related to these topics. Not only do these discussions educate the group on important issues, but they also help lab members integrate inclusive practices into their day-to-day endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;By integrating inclusive principles into his teaching and mentoring, Gedik creates a culture where students are supported personally and academically. In fact, a nominator shared that many of these practices stem from the professional development courses that Gedik voluntarily attends. His proactive approach not only benefits his current students, but also sets a standard that influences others as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In addition to his efforts within the lab, Gedik is proactive in scientific outreach and mentorship within the broader community. He attends annual science fairs in educationally under-resourced communities, aiming to inspire the younger generation to pursue careers in STEM. One nominator praises these fairs for “igniting interest in science and technology among diverse audiences,” with a particular focus on inspiring the younger generation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <description><![CDATA[Rising senior and Army ROTC cadet Alexander Edwards and Aneal Krishnan ’02 discuss a new UROP fellowship with the Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pursuing an Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program project (or two or three) is a quintessential part of the academic experience at MIT. The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://urop.mit.edu/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;program, known as UROP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;allows students to be “shoulder to shoulder” with faculty, graduate students, and affiliated researchers in MIT’s labs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Given the plethora of research options and disciplines — everything from getting a crash course in advancing quantum computing to developing neuroprosthetics — it’s no surprise that over 90 percent of undergraduates end up doing a UROP by the time they graduate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The half-century-old program continues to evolve, adapting to student interest. Consider the experience of rising senior Alexander Edwards, a nuclear and mechanical engineering student and cadet in the Army ROTC program. The Alabama native leveraged his military training thanks to a new fellowship with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://isn.mit.edu/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; (ISN), an endeavor in which MIT, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), and industry partners work together to develop technologies that advance the protection, survivability, and mission capabilities of the U.S. Armed Forces. That fellowship is thanks to a gift of alumnus and ROTC graduate Aneal Krishnan ’02, who commissioned as an infantry officer in the U.S. Army. Here, Edwards and Krishnan describe the unique UROP experience and offer advice for future students.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What was special about having a UROP focused on the challenges that a soldier in the field might face, such as the decades-long challenges of managing excess weight while also having proper ballistic protection?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edwards:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Having a UROP specifically designed for MIT ROTC cadets has allowed me to grow my technical skills while also helping contribute to national defense. The ISN works on an array of different interesting research projects related to defense technologies in any and every STEM discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team members collaborate on basic research to create new materials, devices, processes, and systems, and on applied research to transition promising results toward practical products useful to the war fighter. U.S. Army members at the ISN also give guidance on soldier protection and survivability needs and evaluate the relevance of research proposed to address these needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These collaborations help identify dual-use applications for ISN-derived technologies for firefighters, police officers, other first responders, and the civilian community at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Krishnan:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;The ISN was founded at MIT in 2002, and since its founding, the ISN’s research has been the genesis of over 140 patents, more than 50 startups, and dozens of major transitions of fieldable products. Through the MIT ROTC/ISN fellowship, the ISN benefits from the work of exceptional science and engineering students from MIT, who will also be future military leaders and can bring a real-world perspective to their work. The ROTC cadets benefit by pursuing research as part of their degree in areas in which they are passionate, and that will benefit them in their endeavors after graduation. An overarching success of this fellowship is that there is now a connection between ROTC and MIT’s DoD labs that did not exist in my time as an undergraduate. As a tangible success in this regard, in March 2024, Lt. General Maria Barrett, the commanding general of U.S. Army Cyber Command, conducted a visit at MIT coordinated by both ROTC and the ISN, further elevating the profile of the Institute amongst the DoD top brass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What was your specific project?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edwards:&lt;/strong&gt; My project for the past year has been related to calculating the losses on a radio-photovoltaic thermo-nuclide generator (RTG), also known as a nuclear battery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My classmate, fellow Army ROTC cadet and fellowship recipient rising junior William Cruz, worked with nanocomputing and piezoelectric fibers to create heartbeat-sensing clothing. He and I can attest that both projects have been incredibly fulfilling, both personally and professionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside the UROPs, Mr. Krishnan took us on a day trip in January to Washington D.C., where we were treated to a host of amazing networking opportunities at an array of organizations that seek to transition innovation out of the lab and into the front lines such as Silicon Valley Defense Group, JP Morgan, Peraton, and from In-Q-Tel, the global, not-for-profit strategic investor for the U.S. national security community and America's allies, hosted by fellow MIT alumnus David LoBosco ’02.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What lessons or takeaways did you gain from this experience? What advice might you share with other students?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edwards:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;My main takeaways from all these meetings were, first, the importance of proper communication between the private sector and the government, something that has been lacking of late, and secondly, how I may be able to apply my technical background to consulting, investment, or many other fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I would recommend this program to future MIT ROTC cadets, and both Cadet Cruz and I are exceedingly grateful to Mr. Krishnan and the ISN for the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Krishnan:&lt;/strong&gt; Cadets Edwards and Cruz will now be able to share their experiences with the next class of prospective cadet researchers, thereby increasing the fellowship’s reach and impact. Future initiatives are to expand the fellowship to MIT’s Air Force and Navy ROTC programs, schedule more visits of senior military leaders to both ROTC and ISN, and connect fellowship recipients with ISN startups for career opportunities. And for my part, I’m incredibly fortunate to have met such outstanding Americans as cadets Edwards and Cruz. I’m excited to see where life takes them and hope to be a mentor along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following announcement was released jointly by MIT Lincoln Laboratory and the National Strategic Research Institute.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT Lincoln Laboratory and the National Strategic Research Institute (NSRI) at the University of Nebraska (NU), a university-affiliated research center designated by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), have established a joint student research program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to bring together the scientific expertise, cutting-edge capabilities, and student capacity of NU and MIT for critical issues within global health and agricultural security, aiming to foster solutions to detect and neutralize emerging biological threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are excited to combine forces with NSRI to develop critical biotechnologies that will enhance national security," says Catherine Cabrera, who leads Lincoln Laboratory's Biological and Chemical Technologies Group. "This partnership underscores our shared commitment to safeguarding America through scientific leadership."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In an era of rapidly evolving dangers, we must stay ahead of the curve through continuous innovation," says&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://nsri.nebraska.edu/experienced-experts/david-roberts"&gt;David Roberts&lt;/a&gt;, the NSRI research director for special programs. "This partnership harnesses a unique combination of strengths from two leading academic institutions and two research institutes to create new paradigms in biological defense."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With funding from a DoD agency, the collaborators conducted a pilot of the program embedded within the MIT &lt;a href="https://meche.mit.edu/featured-classes/engineering-systems-design-and-development-ii"&gt;Engineering Systems Design and Development II course&lt;/a&gt;. The students’ challenge was to develop methods to rapidly screen for novel biosynthetic capabilities. Currently, such methods are limited by the lack of standardized, high-throughput devices that can support the culture of traditionally “uncultivable” microorganisms, which severely limits the cell diversity that could be probed for bioprospecting or biomanufacturing applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://web.mit.edu/thorsen/www/" target="_blank"&gt;Todd Thorsen&lt;/a&gt;, a technical staff member in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/biotechnology-and-human-systems/biological-and-chemical-technologies"&gt;Biological and Chemical Technologies Group&lt;/a&gt; at Lincoln Laboratory, MIT students created the project, "Bioprospecting Experimentation Apparatus with Variable Environmental Regulation," which focused on developing simple high-throughput tools with integrated environmental control systems to expand the environmental testing envelope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This program, which emphasizes both engineering design and prototyping, challenges students to take what they learned in the classroom in their past undergraduate and graduate studies, and apply it to a real-world problem," Thorsen says. "For many students, the hands-on nature of this course is an exciting opportunity to test their abilities to prioritize what is important in developing products that are both functional and easy to use. What I found most impressive was the students’ ability to apply their collective knowledge to the design and prototyping of the biomedical devices, emphasizing their diverse backgrounds in areas like fluid mechanicals, controls, and solid mechanics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, 12 mechanical engineering students contributed to the program, producing and validating a gas gradient manifold prototype and a droplet-dispensing manifold that has the potential to generate arbitrary pH gradients in industry-standard 96-well plates used for biomedical research. These devices will greatly simplify and accelerate the microculture of complex mixtures of organisms, like bacteria populations, where the growth conditions are unknown, allowing the end user to use the manifolds to dial in the optimal environmental parameters without the need for expensive, bulky hardware like the anaerobic chambers typically used for microbiology research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This class was my first experience with microfluidics and biotech, and thanks to our sponsors, I gained the confidence to pursue a career path in biotech," says Rachael Rosco, an MIT mechanical engineering graduate student. "The project itself was meaningful, and I know that our work will hopefully one day make an impact. Who knows, maybe one day it will lead to cultivating extremophile bacteria on a foreign planet!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collaboration will continue to seek DoD research funding to create workforce development opportunities for top scientific talent and introduce students to long-standing DoD challenges. Projects will take place nationwide at several NSRI, NU, Lincoln Laboratory, and MIT facilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Being able to say, “I fly helicopters” — specifically the Seahawk series that boast a maximum cruise elevation of 10,000 feet and 210 miles per hour — must be a great conversation starter. So must saying that you are helping to train a future generation of naval cadets at MIT, Harvard and Tufts universities, and other local schools.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;U.S. Navy Commander&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://nrotc.mit.edu/executive-officers-biography" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jennifer A. Huck&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, executive officer (XO) for the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) consortium, can do both. Called the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://nrotc.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Old Ironsides Battalion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, the unit comprises around 80 midshipmen across six universities and is housed on the MIT campus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After 20 years of active duty, Huck has now returned home, in a sense. She herself was commissioned through the NROTC program at Boston University, where she earned a BS in biomedical engineering in 2003. Here, Huck explains her role and how the Naval ROTC program prepares students to commission as officers in the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps upon graduation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Tell us a bit about your own military and academic career. Why did you decide to pursue that path? What has surprised you along the way? And of course, what is it like to fly helicopters?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I have always been a person who seeks a sense of purpose, and I enjoy being part of a team. I also grew up being very involved in athletics and wanted to keep physical fitness as a big part of my life. After learning about various educational opportunities the Navy offers, I instantly gravitated towards the idea of joining because I felt that the job checked the blocks for so many things that are important to me. I joined Navy ROTC at Boston University in 1999 and I have had nothing but amazing experiences since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a midshipman, I explored career paths in medicine and nuclear power. My summer training experience in 2002 onboard the aircraft carrier &lt;a href="https://www.airlant.usff.navy.mil/cvn75/" name="_Hlk173332863"&gt;&lt;em&gt;USS Harry S Truman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sealed the deal for me wanting to be a naval aviator. The freedom of flight was exhilarating and the responsibility, leadership, and skill required of the pilots fueled my drive for purpose and mission accomplishment — not to mention the views from above were quite nice!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So after graduating from BU, I completed naval flight training and earned my pilot wings in August 2005. I subsequently spent over 10 years flying missions operating in the Middle East, Horn of Africa, and Western Pacific.&amp;nbsp;Flying multi-million dollar combat helicopters is thrilling and fulfilling as it requires precise control, coordination, and focus to agilely maneuver amidst immersive aircraft vibrations, loud rotor-blade noise, and anything else that may be in the area (weather, threats, terrain, etc).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout my career, I’ve had many exciting assignments, including flying those H-60 combat helicopters, working operations at the U.S. Embassy in Colombia, developing requirements for next-generation technologies at the Pentagon, and instructing students in flight school and in ROTC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has, however, been the people, and not necessarily the jobs, that have kept me in the Navy for 21 years. There is no other organization where you will find the same camaraderie as military service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;: MIT has a long history of national service and takes great pride in its ROTC students — especially given the dual rigor of the curriculum and the military training. Can you explain what an XO does day to day and how you support students?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; The NROTC executive officer plays a vital role in the leadership and administration of the program. As second-in-command, I assist the NROTC commander, Captain Jack Houdeshell, in managing the unit’s operations. I directly supervise the unit staff and midshipmen and provide guidance, mentorship, and support to ensure everyone fulfills their roles and responsibilities effectively.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since our unit’s mission is to train midshipmen, I also oversee the development and execution of our training curriculum, which includes naval science classes, physical training, laboratory sessions, drill instruction, and other professional development activities. This oversight ensures that midshipmen are prepared to commission as officers in the United States Navy and Marine Corps upon graduation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT graduates are top performers in the fleet, and the rigorous four-year program they complete here prepares them to be ready to respond to future technical and leadership challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;As part of your service, you’ve traveled around the world, living and working in a half-dozen countries. How would you characterize the culture at MIT? What’s been special about your time on campus?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Like I previously mentioned, one of the most exciting parts about my job is the dynamic environment I operate in. Part of the dynamics involves traveling around the world and experiencing different cultures and conditions. My experience at MIT, in many ways, parallels certain cultural experiences from around the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, MIT has a diverse student body with students representing numerous ethnic backgrounds, countries, and experiences. MIT students are very talented, hard-working, and focused on achieving their goals; they want to make the world a better place. MIT encourages freedom of thought and unique problem-solving, similar to what is required of our military and global leaders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What I find most special about MIT is the people. Similar to the Navy, MIT creates a global network of friendships and lifelong connections. I consider the MIT community to be my “MIT family.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>The rules of the game</title>

  <description><![CDATA[Rising superpowers like China are “cautious opportunists” in global institutions, and the U.S. should avoid overreaction, PhD student Raymond Wang argues.]]></description>
  <pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2024 15:00:00 -0400</pubDate>

        <dc:creator>Leda Zimmerman | Department of Political Science</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At the core of Raymond Wang’s work lies a seemingly simple question: Can’t we just get along?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wang, a fifth-year political science graduate student, is a native of Hong Kong who witnessed firsthand the shakeup and conflict engendered by China’s takeover of the former British colony. “That type of experience makes you wonder why things are so complicated,” he says. “Why is it so hard to live with your neighbors?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Wang is focused on ways of managing a rapidly intensifying U.S.-China competition, and more broadly, on identifying how China — and other emerging global powers — bend, break, or creatively accommodate international rules in trade, finance, maritime, and arms control matters to achieve their ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current game for global dominance between the United States and China continually threatens to erupt into dangerous confrontation. Wang’s research aims to construct a more nuanced take on China’s behaviors in this game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“U.S. policy towards China should be informed by a better understanding of China’s behaviors if we are to avoid the worst-case scenario,” Wang believes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Selective and smart”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Wang’s major research thrusts is the ongoing trade war between the two nations. “The U.S. views China as rewriting the rules, creating an alternative world order — and accuses China of violating World Trade Organization (WTO) rules,” says Wang. “But in fact, China has been very selective and smart about responding to these rules.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One critical, and controversial, WTO matter involves determining whether state-owned enterprises are, in the arcane vocabulary of the group, “public bodies,” which are subject to sometimes punitive WTO rules. The United States asserts that if a government owns 51 percent of a company, it is a public body. This means that many essential Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) — manufacturers of electric vehicles, steel, or chemicals, for example — would fall under WTO provisions, and potentially face punitive discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But China isn’t the only nation with SOEs. Many European countries, including stalwart U.S. partners France and Norway, subsidize companies that qualify as public bodies according to the U.S. definition. They, too, could be subject to tough WTO regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could harm a swathe of the E.U. economy,” says Wang. “So China intelligently made the case to the international community that the U.S. position is extreme, and has pushed for a more favorable interpretation through litigation at the WTO.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Wang, this example highlights a key insight of his research: “Rising powers such as China exhibit cautious opportunism,” he says. “China will try to work with the existing rules as much as possible, including bending them in creative ways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when it comes down to it, Wang argues, China would rather avoid the costs of building something completely new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you can repurpose an old tool, why would you buy a new one?” he asks. “The vast majority of actions China is taking involves reshaping the existing order, not introducing new rules or blowing up institutions and building new ones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewing key players&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To bolster his theory of “cautious opportunism,” Wang’s doctoral project sets out a suite of rule-shaping strategies adopted by rising powers in international organizations. His analysis is driven by case studies of disputes recently concluded, or ongoing, in the WTO, the World Bank, and other bodies responsible for defining and policing rules that govern all manner of international relations and commerce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gathering evidence for his argument, Wang has been interviewing people critical to the disputes on all sides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My approach is to figure out who was in the room when certain decisions were made and talk to every single person there,” he says. “For the WTO and World Bank, I’ve interviewed close to 50 relevant personnel, including front-line lawyers, senior leadership, and former government officials.” These interviews took place in Geneva, Singapore, Tokyo, and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But writing about disputes that involve China poses a unique set of problems. “It’s difficult to talk to actively serving Chinese officials, and in general, nobody wants to go on the record because all the content is sensitive.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Wang moves on to cases in maritime governance, he will be reaching out to the key players involved in managing sensitive conflicts in the South China Sea, an Indo-Pacific region dotted with shoals and offering desirable fisheries as well as oil and gas resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even here, Wang suggests, China may find reason to be cautious rather than opportunistic, preferring to carve out exemptions for itself or shift interpretations, rather than overturning the existing rules wholesale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Wang believes China and other rising powers introduce new rules only when conditions open up a window of opportunity: “It may be worth doing so when using traditional tools doesn’t get you what you want, if your competitors are unable or unwilling to counter mobilize against you, and you see that the costs of establishing these new rules are worth it,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond Wang’s dissertation, he has also been part of a research team led by M. Taylor Fravel, Arthur and Ruth Sloan Professor of Political Science, that has published papers on China’s Belt and Road Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From friends to enemies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wang left Hong Kong and its political ferment behind at age 15, but the challenge of dealing with a powerful neighbor and the potential crisis it represented stayed with him. In Italy, he attended a United World College — part of a network of schools bringing together young people from different nations and cultures for the purpose of training leaders and peacemakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a utopian idea, where you force teenagers from all around the world to live and study together and get along for two years,” says Wang. “There were people from countries in the Balkans that were actively at war with each other, who grew up with the memory of air raid sirens and family members who fought each other, but these kids would just hang out together.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coexistence was possible on the individual level, Wang realized, but he wondered, “What systemic thing happens that makes people do messed-up stuff to each other when they are in a group?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this question in mind, he went to the University of St. Andrews for his undergraduate and master’s degrees in international relations and modern history. As China continued its economic and military march onto the world stage, and Iran generated international tensions over its nuclear ambitions, Wang became interested in nuclear disarmament. He drilled down into the subject at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, where he earned a second master’s degree in nonproliferation and terrorism studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaning into a career revolving around policy, he applied to MIT’s security studies doctoral program, hoping to focus on the impact of emerging technologies on strategic nuclear stability. But events in the world led him to pivot. “When I started in the fall of 2019, the U.S.-China relationship was going off the rails with the trade war,” he says. “It was clear that managing the relationship would be one of the biggest foreign policy challenges for the foreseeable future, and I wanted to do research that would help ensure that the relationship wouldn’t tip into a nuclear war.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooling tensions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wang has no illusions about the difficulty of containing tensions between a superpower eager to assert its role in the world order, and one determined to hold onto its primacy. His goal is to make the competition more transparent, and if possible, less overtly threatening. He is preparing a paper, “Guns and Butter: Measuring Spillover and Implications for Technological Competition,” that outlines the different paths taken by the United States and China in developing defense-related technology that also benefits the civilian economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he wades into the final phase of his thesis and contemplates his next steps, Wang hopes that his research insights might inform policymakers, especially in the United States, in their approach to China. While there is a fiercely competitive relationship, “there is still room for diplomacy,” he believes. “If you accept my theory that a rising power will try and use, or even abuse, &amp;nbsp;existing rules as much as possible, then you need non-military — State Department — boots on the ground to monitor what is going on at all the international institutions,” he says. The more information and understanding the United States has of China’s behavior, the more likely it will be able “to cool down some of the tensions,” says Wang. “We need to develop a strategic empathy.”&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>Zach Winn | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Melissa Choi has been named the next director of MIT Lincoln Laboratory, effective July 1. Currently assistant director of the laboratory, Choi succeeds Eric Evans, who &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/eric-evans-steps-down-director-lincoln-laboratory-1206" target="_blank"&gt;will step down&lt;/a&gt; on June 30 after 18 years as director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharing the news in a letter to MIT faculty and staff today, Vice President for Research Ian Waitz noted Choi’s 25-year career of “outstanding technical and advisory leadership,” both at MIT and in service to the defense community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Melissa has a marvelous technical breadth as well as excellent leadership and management skills, and she has presented a compelling strategic vision for the Laboratory,” Waitz wrote. “She is a thoughtful, intuitive leader who prioritizes communication, collaboration, mentoring, and professional development as foundations for an organizational culture that advances her vision for Lab-wide excellence in service to the nation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choi’s appointment marks a new chapter in Lincoln Laboratory’s storied history working to keep the nation safe and secure. As a federally funded research and development center&amp;nbsp;operated by MIT for the Department of Defense, the laboratory has provided the government an independent perspective on critical science and technology issues of national interest for more than 70 years. Distinctive among national R&amp;amp;D labs, the laboratory specializes in both long-term system development and rapid demonstration of operational prototypes, to protect and defend the nation against advanced threats. In tandem with its role in developing technology for national security, the laboratory’s integral relationship with the MIT campus community enables impactful partnerships on fundamental research, teaching, and workforce development in critical science and technology areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a time of great global instability and fast-evolving threats, the mission of Lincoln Laboratory has never been more important to the nation,”&amp;nbsp;says MIT President Sally Kornbluth. “It is also vital that the laboratory apply government-funded, cutting-edge technologies to solve critical problems in fields from space exploration to climate change. With her depth and breadth of experience, keen vision, and straightforward style, Melissa Choi has earned enormous trust and respect across the Lincoln and MIT communities. As Eric Evans steps down, we could not ask for a finer successor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choi has served as assistant director of Lincoln Laboratory since 2019, with oversight of five of the Lab’s nine technical divisions: Biotechnology and Human Systems, Homeland Protection and Air Traffic Control, Cyber Security and Information Sciences, Communication Systems, and ISR and Tactical Systems. Engaging deeply with the needs of the broader defense community, Choi served for six years on the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board, with a term as vice chair, and was appointed to the DoD’s Threat Reduction Advisory Committee. She is currently a member of the national Defense Science Board’s Permanent Subcommittee on Threat Reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having dedicated her entire career to Lincoln Laboratory, Choi says her long tenure reflects a commitment to the lab’s work and community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Through my career, I have been fortunate to have had incredibly innovative and motivated people to collaborate with as we solve critical national security challenges,” Choi says. “Continuing to work with such a strong, laboratory-wide team as director&amp;nbsp;is one of the most exciting aspects of the job for me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Success through collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choi came to Lincoln Laboratory as a technical staff member in 1999, with a doctoral degree in applied mathematics. As she progressed to lead research teams, including the Systems and Analysis Group and then the Active Optical Systems Group, Choi learned the value of pooling expertise from researchers across the laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was able to shift between a lot of different projects very early on in my career, from radar systems to sensor networks. Because I wasn't an expert at the time in any one of those fields, I learned to reach out to the many different experts at the laboratory,” Choi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choi maintained that mindset through all of her roles at the laboratory, including as head of the Homeland Protection and Air Traffic Control Division, which she led from 2014 and 2019. In that role, she helped bring together diverse technology and human systems expertise to establish the Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief Group. Among other achievements, the group provided support to FEMA and other emergency response agencies after the 2017 hurricane season caused unprecedented flooding and destruction across swaths of Texas, Florida, the Caribbean, and Puerto Rico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were able to rapidly prototype and field multiple technologies to help with the recovery efforts,” Choi says. “It was an amazing example of how we can apply our national security focus to other critical national problems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of her technical and advisory achievements, Choi has made an impact at Lincoln Laboratory through her commitments to an inclusive workplace. In 2020, she co-led the study “Preventing Discrimination and Harassment and Promoting an Inclusive Culture at MIT Lincoln Laboratory.” The work was part of a longstanding commitment to supporting colleagues in the workplace through extensive mentoring and participation in employee resource groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have felt a sense of belonging at the laboratory since the minute I came here, and I’ve had the benefit of support from leaders, mentors, and advocates since then. Improving support systems is very important to me,” says Choi, who will be the first woman to lead Lincoln Laboratory. “Everyone should be able to feel that they belong and can thrive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, Choi helped the laboratory navigate the disruptions — with its operations deemed essential — which she says taught her a lot about leading through adversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We solve hard problems at the laboratory all the time, but to get thrown into a problem that we had never seen before was a learning experience,” Choi says. “We saw the entire lab come together, from leadership to each of the divisions and departments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That synergy has also helped Choi form strategic partnerships within and outside of the laboratory to enhance its mission. Drawing on her knowledge of the laboratory's capabilities and its history of developing impactful systems for NASA and NOAA, Choi recently led the formation of a new Civil Space Systems and Technology Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were seeing this convergence between Department of Defense and civilian space initiatives, as going to the Moon, Mars, and the cislunar area [between the earth and moon] has become a big emphasis for the entire country generally,” Choi explains. “It seemed like a good time for us to pull those two sides together and grow our NASA portfolio. It gives us a great opportunity to collaborate with MIT centrally, and it ties in with our other strategic directions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building on success&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choi believes her trajectory through the technical ranks of Lincoln Laboratory will help her lead it now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That experience gives me a view into what it's like at multiple levels of the laboratory,” Choi says. “I’ve seen what’s worked and what hasn't worked, and I've learned from different perspectives and leadership styles.&amp;nbsp;Strong leaders are crucial, but it’s important to recognize&amp;nbsp;that the bulk of the work gets done by the technical, support, and administrative employees across our divisions, departments, and offices.&amp;nbsp;Remembering being an early staff member helps you understand how hard and exciting the work is, and also how critical those contributions are for our mission.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choi says she is also looking forward to expanding the laboratory's collaboration with MIT’s main campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So many areas, from AI to climate to space, have opportunity for us to come together,” Choi says. “We also have some great models of progress, like the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://beaverworks.ll.mit.edu/CMS/bw/" target="_blank"&gt;Beaver Works Center&lt;/a&gt; or the Department of the Air Force – MIT Artificial Intelligence Accelerator program, that we can build from. Everyone here is very excited about doing that, and it will absolutely be a priority for me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Choi plans to lead Lincoln Laboratory using the approach that’s proven successful throughout her career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe very much that I should not be the smartest person in the room, and I rely on the smart people working with me,” Choi says. “I’m part of a team and I work with a team to lead. That has always been my style: Set a vision and goals, and empower and support the people I work with to make decisions and build on that strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Owen Coté PhD ’96, a principal research scientist with the MIT Security Studies Program (SSP), passed away on June 8 after battling cancer. He joined SSP in 1997 as associate director, a role he held for the rest of his life. He guided the program through the course of three directors — each profiting from his wise counsel, leadership skills, and sense of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Owen was an indomitable scholar and leader of the field of security studies,” says M. Taylor Fravel, the Arthur and Ruth Sloan Professor of Political Science and the director of SSP. “Owen was the heart and soul of SSP and a one-of-a-kind scholar, colleague, and friend. He will be greatly missed by us all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having earned his doctorate in political science at MIT, Coté embodied the program’s professional and scholarly values. Through his research and his teaching, he nurtured three of the program’s core interests — the study of nuclear weapons and strategy, the study of the relationship between technological change and military practice, and the application of organization theory to understanding the behavior of military institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the author of&amp;nbsp;“The Third Battle: Innovation in the U.S. Navy’s Silent Cold War Struggle with Soviet Submarines,” a book analyzing the sources of the U.S. Navy’s success in its Cold War antisubmarine warfare effort, and a co-author of&amp;nbsp;“Avoiding Nuclear Anarchy: Containing the Threat of Loose Russian Nuclear Weapons and Fissile Material.” He also wrote on the future of naval doctrine, nuclear force structure issues, and the threat of weapons of mass destruction terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was an influential national expert on undersea warfare. According to&amp;nbsp;Ford International Professor of Political Science Barry Posen, Coté’s colleague for several decades who served as SSP director from 2006 to 2019, “Owen is credited, among others, with helping the U.S. Navy see the wisdom of transforming four ‘surplus’ Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines into cruise missile platforms that serve the Navy and the country to this day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coté’s principal interest in recent years was maritime “war in three dimensions” — surface, air, and subsurface — and how they interacted and changed with advancing technology.&amp;nbsp;He recently completed a book manuscript on this complex history. At the time of his death, he was also preparing a manuscript that analyzed the sources of innovative military doctrine, using cases that compared U.S. Navy responses to moments in the Cold War when U.S. leaders worried about the vulnerability of land-based missiles to Soviet attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No one in our field was as knowledgeable about military organizations and operations, the politics that drives security policy, and relevant theories of international relations as Owen,” according to Harvey Sapolsky, MIT&amp;nbsp;Professor of Public Policy and Organization, Emeritus, and SSP director from 1989 to 2006. “And no one was more willing to share that knowledge to help others in their work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This broad portfolio of expertise served him well as co-editor and ultimately editor of the journal &lt;em&gt;International Security,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;the longtime flagship journal of the security studies subfield.&amp;nbsp;His colleague and editor-in-chief of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;International Security&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Steven Miller &lt;a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/remembering-owen-cote"&gt;reflects&lt;/a&gt; that, “Owen combined a brilliant analytic mind, a mischievous sense of humor, and a passion for his work. His contribution to&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;International Security&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;was immense and will be missed, as I relied on his judgement with total confidence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coté believed in sharing his scholarly findings with the policy community. With Cindy Williams, a principal research scientist at SSP, he helped organize and ran a series of national security simulations for military officers and Department of Defense (DoD) civilians in the national security studies program at the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University. He regularly produced major conferences at MIT, with several on the U.S. nuclear attack submarine force perhaps the most influential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was passionate about nurturing younger scholars. In recent years, he led programs for visiting fellows at SSP: the Nuclear Security Fellows Program and the Grand Strategy, Security, and Statecraft Fellows Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caitlin Talmage PhD ’11, one of his former students and now an associate professor of political science at MIT, describes Coté as "a devoted mentor and teacher. His classes sparked many dissertations, and he engaged deeply with students and their research, providing detailed feedback, often over steak dinners. Despite his towering expertise in the field of security studies, Owen was always patient, generous, and respectful toward his students. He continued to advise many even after graduation as they launched their careers, myself included. He will be profoundly missed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phil Haun PhD ’10, also one of Coté’s students and now&amp;nbsp;professor and director of the Rosenberg Deterrence Institute at the Naval War College, describes Coté as “a mentor, colleague, and friend to a generation of MIT SSP graduate students,” noting that “arguably his greatest achievement and legacy are the scholars he nurtured and loved.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Haun notes, “Owen’s expertise, with a near encyclopedic knowledge of innovations in military technology, coupled with a gregarious personality and willingness to share his time and talent, attracted dozens of students to join in a journey to study important issues of international security. Owen’s passion for his work and his eagerness to share a meal and a drink with those with similar interests encouraged those around him. The degree to which so many MIT SSP alums have remained connected to the program is testament to the caring community of scholars that Owen helped create.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posen describes Coté&amp;nbsp;as a “larger-than-life figure and the most courageous and determined human being I have ever met.&amp;nbsp;He could light up a room when he was among people he liked, and he liked most people.&amp;nbsp;He was in the office suite nearly every day of the week, including weekends, and his door was usually open.&amp;nbsp;Professors, fellows, and graduate students would drop by to seek his counsel on issues of every kind, and it was not uncommon for an expected 10-minute interlude to turn into a one-hour seminar.&amp;nbsp;He had a truly unique ability to understand the interaction of technology and military operations.&amp;nbsp;I have never met anyone who could match him in this ability. He also knew how to really enjoy life. It is an incredible loss on many, many levels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Miller &lt;a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/remembering-owen-cote"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;, “I got to know Owen while serving as supervisor of his senior thesis at Harvard College in 1981–82. That was the beginning of a lifelong friendship and happily our careers remained entangled for the remainder of his life. I will miss the wonderful, decent human being, the dear friend, the warm and committed colleague. He was a brave soul, suffering much, overcoming much, and contributing much. It is deeply painful to lose such a friend.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Owen was kind and generous, and though he endured much, he never complained,” says Sapolsky. “He gave wonderfully organized and insightful talks, improved the writing of others with his editing, and always gave sound advice to those who were wise enough to seek it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After graduating from Harvard College in 1982 and before returning to graduate school, Coté worked at the Hudson Institute and the Center for Naval Analyses. He received his PhD in 1996 from MIT, where he specialized in U.S. defense policy and international security affairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before joining SSP in 1997, he served as assistant director of the International Security Program at Harvard's Center for Science and International Affairs (now the Belfer Center).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was the son of Ann F. Coté and the late Owen R. Coté Sr. His family wrote in his&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://click.comms.hks.harvard.edu/?qs=7e1fd2047026c3e9774381c627549661fb5f81703be917faa697658b0c928977a63c3c4b3d2446abf45c13e492e2217f07276ef52326e09d" title="https://click.comms.hks.harvard.edu/?qs=7e1fd2047026c3e9774381c627549661fb5f81703be917faa697658b0c928977a63c3c4b3d2446abf45c13e492e2217f07276ef52326e09d"&gt;obituary&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that at home, he was always up for a good discussion about&amp;nbsp;Star Wars&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;Harry Potter&amp;nbsp;movies. Motorcycle magazines were a lifelong passion. He was a devoted uncle to his nieces Eliza Coté, Sofia Coté, and Livia Coté, as well as his self-proclaimed “fake” niece and nephew, Sam and Nina Harrison.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to his mother and his nieces, he is survived by his siblings: Mark T. Coté of Blacksburg, Virginia; Peter H. Coté and his wife Nina of Topsfield, Massachusetts; and Suzanne Coté Curtiss and her husband Robin of Cape Neddick, Maine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On May 31, the U.S. Department of Defense's chief technology officer, Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Heidi Shyu, presented Eric Evans with the Department of Defense (DoD) Medal for Distinguished Public Service. This award is the highest honor given by the secretary of defense to private citizens for their significant service to the DoD. Evans was selected for his leadership as director of MIT Lincoln Laboratory and as vice chair and chair of the Defense Science Board (DSB).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have gotten to know Eric well in the last three years, and I greatly appreciate his leadership, proactiveness, vision, intellect, and humbleness," Shyu stated in her remarks during the May 31 ceremony held at the laboratory. "Eric has a willingness and ability to confront and solve the most difficult problems for national security. His distinguished public service will continue to have invaluable impacts on the department and the nation for decades to come."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his tenure in both roles over more than a decade, Evans has cultivated relationships at the highest levels within the DoD. Since stepping into his role as laboratory director in 2006, he has advised eight defense secretaries and seven deputy defense secretaries. Under his leadership, the laboratory delivered advanced capabilities for national security in a broad range of technology areas, including cybersecurity, space surveillance, biodefense, artificial intelligence, laser communications, and quantum computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evans ensured that the laboratory addressed not only existing DoD priorities, but also emerging and future threats. He foresaw the need for and established three new technical divisions covering&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/cyber-security-and-information-sciences"&gt;Cyber Security and Information Sciences&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/homeland-protection"&gt;Homeland Protection&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/biotechnology-and-human-systems"&gt;Biotechnology and Human Systems&lt;/a&gt;. When the Covid-19 pandemic struck, he quickly pivoted the laboratory to aid the national response. To ensure U.S. competitiveness in an ever-evolving defense landscape, he advocated for the modernization of major test ranges, including the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/about/facilities/reagan-test-site"&gt;Reagan Test Site&lt;/a&gt; for which the laboratory serves as scientific advisor, and secured funding for new state-of-the-art facilities such as the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/news/construction-contract-awarded-new-semiconductor-facility-mit-lincoln-laboratory"&gt;Compound Semiconductor Laboratory – Microsystem Integration Facility&lt;/a&gt;. He also strengthened ties with MIT campus on research collaborations to drive innovation and expand educational opportunities for preparing the next generation of the DoD STEM workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In parallel, Evans served on the DSB, the leading board for providing science and technology advice to DoD senior leadership. Evans served as DSB vice chair from 2014 to 2020 and chair since 2020. Over the years, Evans led or supported more than 30 DSB studies of direct importance to the DoD. Most notably, he initiated a new Strategic Options Permanent Subcommittee focused on identifying systems and technology to prepare the nation for future defense needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The medal is a wonderful and richly deserved recognition of Eric’s contributions to MIT and to national security,” said Ian Waitz, MIT’s vice president for research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Evans&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/eric-evans-steps-down-director-lincoln-laboratory-1206"&gt;steps down from his role&lt;/a&gt; as Lincoln Laboratory director on July 1, he will transition to a professor of practice appointment on the MIT campus and will continue to strengthen ties between the Laboratory and MIT campus and work with DoD leaders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It’s a question that occupies significant bandwidth in the world of nuclear arms security: Could hypersonic missiles, which fly at speeds of least five times the speed of sound, increase the likelihood of nuclear war?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eli Sanchez, who recently completed his doctoral studies at MIT's Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering (NSE), explored these harrowing but necessary questions under the guidance of &lt;a href="https://lnsp.mit.edu/r-scott-kemp" target="_blank"&gt;Scott Kemp&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor at NSE and director of the &lt;a href="https://lnsp.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;MIT Laboratory for Nuclear Security and Policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A well-rounded interest in science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up in the small railroad town of Smithville, Texas, Sanchez fell in love with basic science in high school. He can’t point to any one subject — calculus, anatomy, physiology — they were all endlessly fascinating. But physics was particularly appealing early on because you learned about abstract models and saw them play out in the real world, Sanchez says. “Even the smallest cellular functions playing out on a larger scale in your own body is cool,” he adds, explaining his love of physiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attending college at the University of Texas in Dallas was even more rewarding, as he could soak in the sciences and feed an insatiable appetite. Electricity and magnetism drew Sanchez in, as did quantum mechanics. “The reality underlying quantum is so counterintuitive to what we expect that the subject was fascinating. It was really cool to learn these very new and sort of foreign rules,” Sanchez says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stoking his interest in science in his undergraduate years, Sanchez learned about nuclear engineering outside of the classroom, and was especially intrigued by its potential for mitigating climate change. A professor with a specialty in nuclear chemistry fueled this interest and it was through a class in radiation chemistry that Sanchez learned more about the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graduating with a major in chemistry and a minor in physics, Sanchez married his love of science with another interest, computational modeling, when he pursued an internship at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. At Oak Ridge, Sanchez worked on irradiation studies on humans by using computational models of the human body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work on nuclear weapons security at NSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Oak Ridge, Sanchez was pretty convinced he wanted to work on computational research in the nuclear field in some way. He appreciates that computational models, when done well, can yield accurate forecasts of the future. One can use models to predict failures in nuclear reactors, for example, and prevent them from happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After test-driving a couple of research options at NSE, Sanchez worked in the field of nuclear weapons security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts in the field have long believed that the weapons or types of delivery systems like missiles and aircraft will affect the likelihood that states will feel compelled to start a nuclear war. The canonical example is a multiple independently-targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) system, which deploys multiple warheads on the same missile. If one missile can take out one warhead, it can destroy five or 10 warheads with just one MRV system. Such a weapons capability, Sanchez points out, is very destabilizing because there’s a strong incentive to attack first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, experts in nuclear arms control have been suggesting that hypersonic weapons are destabilizing, but most of the reasons have been speculative, Sanchez says. “We’re putting these claims to technical scrutiny to see if they hold up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way to test these claims is by focusing on flight paths. Hypersonic missiles have been considered destabilizing because it’s impossible to determine their trajectories. Hypersonic missiles can turn as they fly, so they have destination ambiguity. Unlike ballistic missiles, which have a fixed trajectory, it’s not always apparent where hypersonic missiles are going. When the final target of a missile is unclear it is easy to assume the worst: “They could be mistaken for attacks against nuclear weapons or nuclear command-and-control structures or against national capitals,” Sanchez says, “it could look much more serious than it is, so it could prompt the nation that’s being attacked to respond in a way that will escalate the situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanchez’s doctoral work included modeling the flights of hypersonic weapons to quantify the ambiguities that could lead to escalation. The key was to evaluate the area of ambiguity for missiles with given sets of properties. Part of the work also involved making recommendations that prevent hypersonic weapons from being used in destabilizing ways. A couple of these suggestions included arming hypersonic missiles with conventional (rather than nuclear) warheads and to create no-fly zones around world capitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helping underserved students&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanchez’s work at NSE was not limited to his doctoral studies alone. Along with NSE postdoc &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/helping-make-nuclear-fusion-reality-rachel-bielajew-0103" target="_blank"&gt;Rachel Bielajew&lt;/a&gt; PhD ’24, he started the &lt;a href="https://web.mit.edu/nse/about/gaap.html"&gt;Graduate Application Assistance Program&lt;/a&gt; (GAAP), which helps mitigate some of the disadvantages that underrepresented students are likely to encounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The son of a Latino father and middle-class parents who were themselves the first in their families to graduate from college, Sanchez considers himself fortunate. But he admits that unlike many of his peers, he found graduate school difficult to navigate. “That gave me an appreciation for the position that a lot of people coming from different backgrounds where there’s less higher education in the family might face,” Sanchez says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GAAP’s purpose is to lessen some of these barriers and to connect potential applicants to current NSE graduate students so they can ask questions whose answers might paint a clearer picture of the landscape. Sanchez stepped down after two years of co-chairing the initiative but he continues as mentor. Questions he fields range from finding a research/lab fit to funding opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for opportunities Sanchez himself will follow: a postdoctoral fellowship in the &lt;a href="https://ssp.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Security Studies Program&lt;/a&gt; in the Department of Political Science at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>A careful rethinking of the Iraq War</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The term “fog of war” expresses the chaos and uncertainty of the battlefield. Often, it is only in hindsight that people can grasp what was unfolding around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, additional clarity about the Iraq War has arrived in the form of a new book by MIT political scientist Roger Petersen, which dives into the war’s battlefield operations, political dynamics, and long-term impact. The U.S. launched the Iraq War in 2003 and formally wrapped it up in 2011, but Petersen analyzes the situation in Iraq through the current day and considers what the future holds for the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a decade of research, Petersen identifies four key factors for understanding Iraq’s situation. First, the U.S. invasion created chaos and a lack of clarity in terms of the hierarchy among Shia, Sunni, and Kurdish groups. Second, given these conditions, organizations that comprised a mix of militias, political groups, and religious groups came to the fore and captured elements of the new state the U.S. was attempting to set up. Third, by about 2018, the Shia groups became dominant, establishing a hierarchy, and along with that dominance, sectarian violence has fallen. Finally, the hybrid organizations established many years ago are now highly integrated into the Iraqi state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petersen has also come to believe two things about the Iraq War are not fully appreciated. One is how widely U.S. strategy varied over time in response to shifting circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This was not one war,” says Petersen. “This was many different wars going on. We had at least five strategies on the U.S. side.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while the expressed goal of many U.S. officials was to build a functioning democracy in Iraq, the intense factionalism of Iraqi society led to further military struggles, between and among religious and ethnic groups. Thus, U.S. military strategy shifted as this multisided conflict evolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What really happened in Iraq, and the thing the United States and Westerners did not understand at first, is how much this would become a struggle for dominance among Shias, Sunnis, and Kurds,” says Petersen. “The United States thought they would build a state, and the state would push down and penetrate society. But it was society that created militias and captured the state.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attempts to construct a well-functioning state, in Iraq or elsewhere must confront this factor, Petersen adds. “Most people think in terms of groups. They think in terms of group hierarchies, and they’re motivated when they believe their own group is not in a proper space in the hierarchy. This is this emotion of resentment. I think this is just human nature.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petersen’s book, “&lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/death-dominance-and-state-building-9780197760741?cc=us&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;" target="_blank"&gt;Death, Dominance, and State-Building: The U.S. in Iraq and the Future of American Military Intervention&lt;/a&gt;,” is published today by Oxford University Press. Petersen is the Arthur and Ruth Sloan Professor of Political Science at MIT and a member of the Security Studies Program based at MIT’s Center for International Studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research on the ground&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petersen spent years interviewing people who were on the ground in Iraq during the war, from U.S. military personnel to former insurgents to regular Iraqi citizens, while extensively analyzing data about the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t really come to conclusions about Iraq until six or seven years of applying this method,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, one core fact about the country heavily influenced the trajectory of the war. Iraq’s Sunni Muslims made up about 20 percent or less of the country’s population but had been politically dominant before the U.S. took military action. After the U.S. toppled former dictator Saddam Hussein, it created an opening for the Shia majority to grasp more power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The United States said, ‘We’re going to have democracy and think in individual terms,’ but this is not the way it played out,” Petersen says. “The way it played out was, over the years, the Shia organizations became the dominant force. The Sunnis and Kurds are now basically subordinate within this Shia-dominated state. The Shias also had advantages in organizing violence over the Sunnis, and they’re the majority. They were going to win.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Petersen details in the book, a central unit of power became the political militia, based on ethnic and religious identification. One Shia militia, the Badr Organization, had trained professionally for years in Iran. The local Iraqi leader Moqtada al-Sadr could recruit Shia fighters from among the 2 million people living in the Sadr City slum. And no political militia wanted to back a strong multiethnic government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They liked this weaker state,” Petersen says. “The United States wanted to build a new Iraqi state, but what we did was create a situation where multiple and large Shia militia make deals with each other.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A captain’s war&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In turn, these dynamics meant the U.S. had to shift military strategies numerous times, occasionally in high-profile ways. The five strategies Petersen identifies are clear, hold, build (CHB); decapitation; community mobilization; homogenization; and war-fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The war from the U.S. side was highly decentralized,” Petersen says. Military captains, who typically command about 140 to 150 soldiers, had fairly wide berth in terms of how they were choosing to fight.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was a captain’s war in a lot of ways,” Petersen adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is emphatically driven home in one chapter, “Captain Wright goes to Baghdad,” co-authored with Col. Timothy Wright PhD ’18, who wrote his MIT political science dissertation based on his experience and company command during the surge period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Petersen also notes, drawing on government data, the U.S. also managed to suppress violence fairly effectively at times, particularly before 2006 and after 2008. “The professional soldiers tried to do a good job, but some of the problems they weren’t going to solve,” Petersen says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, all of this raises a conundrum. If trying to start a new state in Iraq was always likely to lead to an increase in Shia power, is there really much the U.S. could have done differently?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s a million-dollar question,” Petersen says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best way to engage with it, Petersen notes, is to recognize the importance of studying how factional groups grasp power through use of violence, and how that emerges in society. It is a key issue running throughout Petersen’s work, and one, he notes, that has often been studied by his graduate students in MIT’s Security Studies Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Death, Dominance, and State-Building” has received praise from foreign-policy scholars. Paul Staniland, a political scientist at the University of Chicago, has said the work combines “intellectual creativity with careful attention to on-the ground dynamics,” and is “a fascinating macro-level account of the politics of group competition in Iraq. This book is required reading for anyone interested in civil war, U.S. foreign policy, or the politics of violent state-building."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petersen, for his part, allows that he was pleased when one marine who served in Iraq read the manuscript in advance and found it interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He said, ‘This is good, and it’s not the way we think about it,’” Petersen says. “That’s my biggest compliment, to have a practitioner say it make them think. If I can get that kind of reaction, I’ll be pleased.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Soaring high, in the Army and the lab</title>

  <description><![CDATA[After three deployments in Afghanistan, Lt. Col. Jill Rahon is pursuing research that will help verify conformation to nuclear treaties.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Starting off as a junior helicopter pilot, Lt. Col. Jill Rahon deployed to Afghanistan three times. During the last one, she was an air mission commander, the&amp;nbsp; pilot who is designated to interface with the ground troops throughout the mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Rahon is a fourth-year doctoral student studying applied physics at the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering (NSE). Under the supervision of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://web.mit.edu/nse/people/faculty/danagoulian.html"&gt;Areg Danagoulian&lt;/a&gt;, she is working on engineering solutions for enforcement of nuclear nonproliferation treaties. Rahon and her husband have 2-year-old twins: “They have the same warm relationship with my advisor that I had with my dad’s (PhD) advisor,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A path to the armed forces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The daughter of a health physicist father and a food chemist mother, Rahon grew up in the Hudson Valley, very close to New York City. Nine-eleven was a life-altering event: “Many of my friends’ fathers and uncles were policemen and firefighters [who] died responding to the attacks,” Rahon says. A hurt and angry teenager, Rahon was determined to do her part to help: She joined the Army and decided to pursue science, becoming part of the first class to enter West Point after 9/11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rahon started by studying strategic history, a field that covers treaties and geopolitical relationships. It would prove useful later. Inspired by her father, who works in the nuclear field, Rahon added on a nuclear science and engineering track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After graduating from West Point, Rahon wanted to join active combat and chose aviation. At flight school in Fort Novosel, Alabama, she discovered that she loved flying. It was there that Rahon learned to fly the legendary Chinook helicopter. In short order, Rahon was assigned to the 101st Airborne Division and deployed to Afghanistan quickly thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As expected, flying in Afghanistan, especially on night missions, was adrenaline-charged. “You’re thinking on the fly, you’re talking on five different radios, you’re making decisions for all the helicopters that are part of the mission,” Rahon remembers. Very often Rahon and her cohorts did not have the luxury of time. “We would get information that would need to be acted on quickly,” she says. During the planning meetings, she would be delighted to see a classmate from West Point function as the ground forces commander. “It would be surprising to see somebody you knew from a different setting halfway around the world, working toward common goals,” Rahon says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also awesome: helping launch the first training program for female pilots to be recruited in the Afghan National Air Force. “I got to meet [and mentor] these strong young women who maybe didn’t have the same encouragement that I had growing up and they were out there hanging tough,” Rahon says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploring physics and nuclear engineering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After serving in the combat forces, Rahon decided she wanted to teach physics at West Point. She applied to become a part of the Functional Area (FA52) as a nuclear and countering weapons of mass destruction officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FA52 officers provide nuclear technical advice to maneuver commanders about nuclear weapons, effects, and operating in a nuclear environment or battlefield. Rahon’s specialty is radiation detection and operations in a nuclear environment, which poses unique threats and challenges to forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing she wanted to teach at West Point, she “brushed up extensively on math and physics” and applied to MIT NSE to pursue a master’s degree. “My fellow students were such an inspiration. They might not have had the same life experiences that I had but were still so mature and driven and knowledgeable not only about nuclear engineering but how that fits in the energy sector and in politics,” Rahon says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resonance analysis to verify treaties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rahon returned to NSE to pursue her doctorate, where she does a “lot of detection and treaty verification work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking at nuclear fuels to verify safeguards for treaties, experts search for the presence and quantities of heavy elements such as uranium, plutonium, thorium, and any of their decay products. To do so nondestructively is of high importance so they don’t destroy a piece of the material or fuel to identify it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rahon’s research is built on resonance analysis, the fact that most midrange to heavy isotopes have unique resonance signatures that are accessed by neutrons of epithermal energy, which is relatively low on the scale of possible neutron energies. This means they travel slowly — crossing a distance of 2 meters in tens of microseconds, permitting their detection time to be used to calculate their energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studying how neutrons of a particular energy interact with a sample to identify worrisome nuclear materials is much like studying fingerprints to solve crimes. Isotopes that have a spike in likelihood of interaction occurring over a small neutron energy are said to have resonances, and these resonance patterns are isotopically unique. Experts can use this technique to nondestructively assess an item, identifying the constituent isotopes and their concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resonance analysis can be used to verify that the fuels are what the nuclear plant owner says they are. “There are a lot of safeguards activities and verification protocols that are managed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to ensure that a state is not misusing nuclear power for ulterior motives,” Rahon points out. And her method helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our technique that leverages resonance analysis is nothing new,” Rahon says, “It's been applied practically since the '70s at very large beam facilities, hundreds of meters long with a very large accelerator that pulses neutrons, and then you're able to correlate a neutron time of flight with a resonance profile. What we’ve done that is novel is we've shrunk it down to a 3-meter system with a portable neutron residence generator and a 2-meter beam path,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobility confers many significant advantages: “This is something that could be conceivably put on the back of a truck and moved to a fuel facility, then driven to the next one for inspections or put at a treaty verification site. It could be taken out to a silo field where they are dismantling nuclear weapons,” Rahon says. However, the miniaturization does come with significant challenges, such as the neutron generator’s impacts on the signal to noise ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rahon is delighted her research can ensure that a necessary fuel source will not be misused. “We need nuclear power. We need low-carbon solutions for energy and we need safe ones. We need to ensure that this powerful technology is not being misused. And that's why these engineering solutions are needed for these safeguards,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rahon sees parallels between her time in active duty and her doctoral research. Teamwork and communication are key in both, she says. Her dad is her role model and Rahon is a firm believer in mentorship, something she nurtured both in the armed forces and at MIT. “My advisor is genuinely a wonderful person who has always given me so much support from not only being a student, but also being a parent,” Rahon adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In turn, Danagoulian has been impressed by Rahon’s remarkable abilities: “Raising twins, doing research in applied nuclear physics, and flying coalition forces into Taliban territory while evading ground fire … [Jill] developed her own research project with minimal help from me and defended it brilliantly during the first part of the exam,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that Rahon flies high no matter which mission she takes on.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT community members can learn more about the Israel-Hamas conflict through a recently developed online course organized by Middle East and North Africa (MENA)/MIT at MIT’s Center for International Studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three-session course, titled “Israel, Palestine, Gaza before and after October 7: Understanding historical context and contrasting narratives,” was first held between Nov. 29 and Dec. 13. More than 500 community members attended those sessions, including students, faculty, staff, and alumni.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course instructor is Peter Krause PhD ’11, an associate professor of political science at Boston College who is also a research affiliate in MIT’s Security Studies Program and an expert on Middle East politics. Krause spent multiple years living in the region to conduct interviews with Israelis and Palestinians for his dissertation and first book, which focused on the history of the Zionist and Palestinian national movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to create a jumping off point for constructive discussions in the MIT community,” Krause says. &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;I want people in the community to be able to have more engaging and informed discussions with each other. Providing this knowledge can allow people to understand each other better.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We all could use more understanding”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sessions were split up into the history of Israelis, Palestinians, and their national movements; conflicts and peace in the region between 1948 and 2023; and a look at the current conflict and the future of Israeli-Palestinian relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next session of the course will feature recordings of the first three sessions as well as a live Q&amp;amp;A with Krause, and will run between Dec. 18 and Jan. 3. Community members can &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffQiG8czWy3teimOJ8MhgH9vcF6YeAzdECOvFtPpoSivY9UQ/viewform" target="_blank"&gt;register with their MIT email address&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 1,100 community members registered for the first session, including many alumni and faculty members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t worry too much about headcount; I think even if we impact a small number of people, but impact them deeply, that can change the world,” says Associate Professor Richard Nielsen, MENA/MIT Faculty Director who is also member of the Security Studies Program and was involved in creating the course. “That said, a sizeable portion of the MIT community is seeking more information on these topics. We all could use more understanding and more ideas about this conflict. MIT is all ideas. When we think about making an impact at MIT, it has to be through education.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Krause says he sought to provide context to the daily news updates on the conflict and to counter what he calls the “junk food information” snippets common on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building empathy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One of the most important things that I hope comes out of these sessions is the building of empathy,” Krause says, which is why he focused the sessions on the narratives of Palestinian and Israelis, not just events. “I think if you have the ability to put yourself in other people’s shoes and in some small way understand what they’re experiencing and how they see things, that’s the basis for more positive engagement, not just in the MIT community but at large.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Krause acknowledged that many community members aren’t able to take a semester-length course on this complex subject. The condensed course tries to accurately depict not just one Israeli perspective or one Palestinian perspective, but the range of opinions within each of those communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When you start to break it down and show the diversity of opinion and experiences on each side, not only does that deepen understanding, but you also start to see the real stakes and the real people behind the news headlines,” Krause says. “I think that’s really important.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional sessions with new updates are also being planned in February. The course is one of the Institute’s many initiatives aimed at bringing a deeper level of understanding to the MIT community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I hope whatever attendees’ political preferences are, they can learn from this, which will ground whatever feelings they have in greater knowledge,” Krause explains. “I believe greater knowledge is going to lead to not just greater understanding, but also better research, better policy, and then hopefully better relationships with people around us, because we understand each other more.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2023/eric-evans-steps-down-director-lincoln-laboratory-1206</guid>
        <dc:creator>Zach Winn | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Eric Evans will be stepping down as director of &lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;MIT Lincoln Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; on July 1, 2024, after 18 years leading a laboratory that has served the nation through its technology research and development since 1951.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evans will transition into the role of fellow in the director’s office at Lincoln Laboratory. He will also hold an appointment on the MIT campus as a senior fellow in the Security Studies Program. He will support the ongoing growth of collaborative research and development between Lincoln Laboratory and the MIT campus, including in areas related to climate change as well as the exploration of advanced technology applications within the Security Studies Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transition will mark the end of a successful tenure in which Evans led the laboratory to adapt and strengthen during a time of significant change for national security needs. He has also served as a key advisor on technology strategy to senior government leaders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It has been an honor and privilege to lead MIT Lincoln Laboratory,” Evans says. “I really appreciate what our laboratory community has done over many years to develop some of the nation’s most important and difficult technical advancements.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lincoln Laboratory is a federally funded research and development center that focuses on technology development, system prototyping, and capability transition to the government, commercial companies, and industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Evans’ leadership, the laboratory established new research and development mission areas in cybersecurity, homeland protection, and biotechnology, and started new programs in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, climate change technology, quantum information science, and energy system resilience. Evans has also strengthened ties with the MIT research community, increased diversity and inclusion efforts, advanced STEM education initiatives, and developed new models for technology transfer to small and medium-size commercial companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evans has also been a member and vice chair and is now chair of the Defense Science Board (DSB). The DSB investigates science and technology needs for the U.S. Department of Defense and strives to solve highly unstructured problems and develop new opportunities for the defense of the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“During his two decades of service to Lincoln Laboratory, Eric’s leadership has proven what an ambitious R&amp;amp;D laboratory and a major institute can achieve together: transformative improvements to the systems that keep the world safe, and a lasting impact on the practice of innovation itself,” says&amp;nbsp;Maria&amp;nbsp;Zuber, MIT’s vice president for research. “Eric has been ahead of the curve in recognizing the global implications of emerging technology areas, and he’s been a trusted advisor on science and technology strategy. The culture of excellence, collaboration, and creativity that Eric has sustained at Lincoln Laboratory ensures its success well into the future. I’m thankful for his service and grateful that he will remain at MIT in his new roles.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zuber announced Evans’ decision in a letter to faculty and staff today. She will appoint a search committee to advise on the selection of the laboratory’s next director.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A career in service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evans started at Lincoln Laboratory in 1988 as a technical staff member. After being named director of Lincoln Laboratory in 2006, he immediately began working with laboratory leaders and staff to develop new mission areas and programs based on national needs. He worked with many at the laboratory to establish a large homeland-protection mission area to create sensors and data integration systems to support the needs of the Department of Homeland Security. Under Evans’ leadership the laboratory developed new homeland air defense capabilities and chemical and biological sensor systems to defend against advanced threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, the laboratory established a cybersecurity mission area to address the dynamic threats posed by cyberattacks. Through many new programs, Lincoln Laboratory researchers developed technology to assist in the protection of defense and civilian cyber networks and to improve the cyber resilience of hardware and software for new computing systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The laboratory also started significant new work in &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/lincoln-laboratory-establishes-biotechnology-and-human-systems-division-1123" target="_blank"&gt;biotechnology and human systems&lt;/a&gt; to develop advanced systems for monitoring health status and assisting in injury recovery for the Army and other sponsors. During the &lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/impact/pandemic-demands-novel-technology" target="_blank"&gt;Covid-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, Evans directed the laboratory to rapidly apply its biotechnology resources to the problems of medical resource allocation, health monitoring, automatic contact tracing, and virus dispersion analysis. Many of these technologies continue to be improved and transitioned to new applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leveraging large defense investments for airborne ground mapping sensors and communication networks, the laboratory established new programs for &lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/impact/technology-confronts-disaster" target="_blank"&gt;humanitarian assistance and disaster relief&lt;/a&gt;, including rapid responses to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, and Hurricane Harvey in Houston, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evans has also focused on expanding other programs to address civilian needs. For example, new aircraft collision-avoidance and weather avoidance technology developed with funding from the FAA has improved flight safety worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NASA-funded programs have also benefited from Lincoln Laboratory initiatives. A major milestone occurred in 2013 with the first two-way demonstration of &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/laser-link-to-moon-trumped-nasa-and-mit-engineers-expectations" target="_blank"&gt;wide-bandwidth laser communication&lt;/a&gt; between the moon and Earth. This innovation opened up new possibilities for NASA, which plans to use the technology to relay data across interplanetary distances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Eric is a gifted and impactful leader who has transferred advances in innovation and research beyond the borders of the lab, in service to the world,” says MIT Provost Cynthia Barnhart.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stronger ties to MIT &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 15 years, the number of Lincoln Laboratory research collaborations with MIT’s campus has increased by nearly a factor of four. The laboratory has expanded collaboration by providing funding for campus research, making many of its facilities available for campus researchers, supporting undergraduate and graduate teaching, and posing new research questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a part of that collaboration, Lincoln Laboratory partnered with MIT’s School of Engineering in 2013 to establish the &lt;a href="https://beaverworks.ll.mit.edu/CMS/bw/" target="_blank"&gt;Beaver Works Center&lt;/a&gt; at MIT. The facility enables collaborative prototyping and technology development by MIT researchers and Lincoln Laboratory technical staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, Lincoln Laboratory worked with the MIT Research Laboratory of Electronics to establish the &lt;a href="https://cqe.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Center for Quantum Engineering&lt;/a&gt; to develop new technologies for quantum computing, sensing, and communication. Lincoln Laboratory is also a contributor to the &lt;a href="https://aia.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Department of the Air Force – MIT Artificial Intelligence Accelerator&lt;/a&gt; program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A prominent example of research collaboration was the 2018 launch of the NASA &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/tess-readies-takeoff-discover-exoplanets-0412" target="_blank"&gt;Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite&lt;/a&gt; (TESS). Lincoln Laboratory worked closely with the MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research to develop the highly sensitive cameras onboard TESS, which since its launch has discovered many new planets orbiting distant stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Striving for an inclusive culture and community service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout his tenure, Evans has also taken steps to enhance the laboratory’s culture to be more inclusive and supportive, significantly increasing the percentage of women and people of color in technical and leadership roles. He established an Office of Diversity and Inclusion, appointed a chief diversity and inclusion officer, and strengthened the Human Resources Department to improve staff recruiting, development, and retention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support the national need for more diverse talent, Evans served for six years as the chair of the board for the &lt;a href="https://www.gemfellowship.org/" target="_blank"&gt;National GEM Consortium&lt;/a&gt;, an organization that provides fellowships to underrepresented minorities pursuing graduate degrees in STEM fields. Through the efforts of many GEM volunteers and staff, the number of GEM fellowships increased significantly during Evans’ tenure leading the board. “I deeply appreciated being involved in this program supporting a critically important need,” Evans says. “The GEM mission is outstanding, and Lincoln Laboratory has very much benefited from their support and from the exceptional &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lZkV8Tx-Rg" target="_blank"&gt;GEM Fellows&lt;/a&gt; we’ve hired.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evans has also strongly supported the creation of many programs to promote K-12 student interest in STEM fields. The laboratory’s STEM outreach programs have reached more than 100,000 students across the country, with nearly 8,000 students per year involved in programs that include building radars, designing small satellites, creating autonomous model cars, and developing new cryptography algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positioned for future success&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, Evans has positioned Lincoln Laboratory to continue evolving its mission. The laboratory is currently pursuing research in emerging technology areas such as artificial intelligence, synthetic biology, and quantum systems and making major investments in new facilities and specialized laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of its facilities modernization, the laboratory recently broke ground for the construction of a large, &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/new-semiconductor-facility-mit-lincoln-laboratory-0208" target="_blank"&gt;$300M microelectronics laboratory&lt;/a&gt; to develop new technology for sensing and computing. A second $300 million Department of Defense investment is for an engineering prototyping facility that will begin construction in 2026. Several other new research and development facilities are planned through a long-term facilities modernization plan supported by the DoD. “These facilities investments will enable the laboratory to remain a strong center for developing revolutionary technology for decades to come,” Evans says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After he steps down as director, Evans will continue to work with the defense community to support studies for current and future defense system and technology needs. He will also be developing and teaching courses related to technology for national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“MIT Lincoln Laboratory is a special place, and I have really enjoyed the experiences of leading and learning. I am most proud of the significant impact our creative leaders and staff have had on national security and society over many years,” Evans says.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Foreign policy scholars examine the China-Russia relationship</title>

  <description><![CDATA[An expert panel discussed the strengths, and limits, of the alignment between the two world powers and U.S. rivals.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Peter Dizikes | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;What is the nature of the relationship between China and Russia today, and how extensively will the two countries keep cooperating in the future? It is a leading question of international relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, a public panel discussion at MIT offered some answers, with foreign-policy scholars offering that China and Russia do not really have an “alliance” in a traditional sense, although they maintain a durable alignment based on not merely convenience but also some deeper common interests and perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The partnership with Russia is big priority for China despite the fallout for certain foreign policy goals from the war in Ukraine, and that’s because there’s a certain amount of interdependence between China and Russia, shared goals, despite differences in many areas,” said Elizabeth Wishnick, an expert in Chinese foreign policy. “The limits to the partnership have always been apparent, but sometimes I think we underestimate its staying power.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those shared goals are apparent for both parties, including from the Russian point of view, as the panelists emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ultimately this certainly is not just a transactional relationship; it’s a relationship that’s been evolving for quite some time,” said Natasha Kuhrt, a scholar specializing in Russian foreign policy and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of how world powers engage and align themselves is certainly topical, with U.S. President Joe Biden meeting China’s president, Xi Jinping, on Thursday in California, a development that might offer a slight thawing of U.S.-China relations. Among other things, China has remained neutral about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, while in the U.S., the Biden administration has adamantly opposed the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event, titled, “A permanent partnership? How Xi and Putin are shaping a turbulent world,” was held online as part of MIT’s Starr Forum series, an ongoing series of public discussions about pressing international matters. The Starr Forum is organized by MIT’s Center for International Studies (CIS), and Thursday’s event was co-sponsored by MIT’s Security Studies Program and the MISTI MIT-Eurasia program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wishnick is currently a senior research scientist in China and Indo-Pacific security affairs at the Center for Naval Analyses, while on leave as a professor of political science at Montclair State University. Her research interests include Chinese foreign policy and China-Russian relations, as well as Arctic geopolitics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kuhrt is a senior lecturer of international peace and security in the Department of War Studies at King's College London. She focuses on Russian and Eurasian security matters and foreign policy, especially pertaining to Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event was moderated by Carol Saivetz, a senior fellow in the MIT Security Studies Program and an expert on Soviet and Russian foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speakers noted that China and Russia are certainly linked by, among other things, economic interests. As Wishnick pointed out, China gets 19 percent of its oil and 25 percent of its coal from Russia; with coal accounting for about half of China’s energy consumption, those import levels are very significant. Indeed, while Russia is only China’s 10th-largest trade partner — behind Malaysia — its role as an energy supplier gives it a crucial role in the Chinese economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Russia gets out of the partnership is not just an export destination for fossil fuels, however. A better relationship with China means Russia needs to commit fewer troops to its 2,300-mile border between the countries. In turn, that has freed up more Russian troops for the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’ve seen also the way in which Moscow deployed a large number of troops from the Russian Far East to the Ukrainian battlefield, and that hardly would have been possible 20-odd years ago,” Kuhrt said. “So, just that fact itself is of great significance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever China’s own high-level assessment of Russia’s invasion, China has kept to its neutral public position with regard to the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Clearly China is concerned about what’s happening in Ukraine but happy to project this kind of neutral stance,” Kuhrt said. “They do come together, Russia and China, in their view of the war essentially as being a proxy war, and being a war against western hegemonism. So, while China does profess to be neutral, I think it seems to be clear that they have a very similar view of the kind of underlying causes of this war, despite Chinese concerns about sovereignty.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She added: “I don’t think it’s an alliance, otherwise China might have come to Russia’s assistance, and I don’t think it will ever be an alliance. The military level of cooperation is not at such a level that we can really call it an alliance relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, as both scholars noted, the seemingly elusive sense of definition behind the relationship may help both partners in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There is a strategic ambiguity about the partnership that increases its deterrent value even without a full-scale alliance,” Wishnick said. “For China, I would say that Russia is a consequential partner, though a problematic one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a question-and-answer session following the presentations, Saivetz asked the panelists which issues could damage the China-Russia relationship. Wishnick suggested that nuclear security issues were “the main red line” in the partnership, along with China’s territorial integrity; both agreed that Arctic geopolitics could also be a source of tension, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scholars were also asked if Xi’s visit to Biden in the U.S. had any bearing on China-Russia relations. They largely concurred that it represented a straightforward matter of China trying to findways to re-engage with the world in order to emerge from its economic doldrums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think that this visit was meant to signal anything to Russia,” Wishnick said. “I think it was, for Xi Jinping it was an opportunity to help revive old economic ties, not just with the U.S. but globally, at a time when the Chinese economy is struggling.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, Xi’s visit might reflect one thing about the China-Russia relationship: the altered size of the countries’ economies. For decades after World War II the U.S. and Russia were the superpowers in the Cold War world, but China’s economic growth has altered that. Now, the U.S. and China have the biggest economies, in that order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is maybe becoming a G2 world, even if they’re not really actually articulating it in that way,” Kuhrt said.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As the armed conflict between Israel and Hamas unfolds, observers and news reports depict the prospect of a near-term halt in warfare as being unlikely. A panel of experts at an MIT public event on Nov. 1 evaluated the dynamics of the conflict, and discussed the elements that could be necessary for longer-term stability — while noting that any ideas about a lasting resolution are necessarily speculative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the discussion was “to better understand some of the historic antecedents and strategic pressures facing various parties, including for Israel, Hamas, other actors in the region, and the United States,” said event moderator Evan Lieberman, director of MIT’s Center for International Studies, in his opening remarks. “We’re here to understand how such extraordinary levels of violence could occur, and what this might mean for the future.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current fighting is a reaction to the Oct. 7 terror attacks by Hamas on Israeli civilians in Israel. In response, Israel has launched military action in Palestinian-populated Gaza, where Hamas is centered. The conflict appears to be one that other countries, for all their concern about limiting escalation in the region, have little ability to influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among other things, “The United States at this point doesn’t have a whole lot of control over events,” observed Steven Simon, a former member of the U.S. National Security Council (NSC), and a former Robert E. Wilhelm Fellow at MIT’s Center for International Studies (CIS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public discussion, “The Israel-Hamas conflict: Expert perspectives on the ongoing crisis,” was held online, with an audience of almost 500 people. The Starr Forum is a public event series held by CIS, focusing on leading issues of global interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In moderating Wednesday’s event, Lieberman, who is also the Total Professor of Political Science and Contemporary Africa, called the ongoing events “a calamity of epic proportions, with regional and global implications.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speakers at the MIT event on Wednesday were Peter Krause PhD ’11, an associate professor of political science at Boston College who studies international security, Middle East politics, and terrorism and political violence, among other subjects; David Kirkpatrick, a staff writer at &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, who previously served as a reporter on international politics for &lt;em&gt;The New York&amp;nbsp;Times&lt;/em&gt;; Marsin Alshamary PhD ’20, an assistant professor at Boston College who focuses on religion, civil society, and social movements in the Shi’a Middle East; and Simon, who served as the NSC senior director for the Middle East and North Africa in the Obama administration and as NSC senior director for counterterrorism in the Clinton administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Krause, who spoke first, noted his research shows that violence tends to increase when there are divisons within a movement, and suggested the attacks by Hamas may have occurred, in part, “to improve its position of power” among Palestinians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while Israel has clearly stated what its military goals are, Krause observed, when it comes to the postmilitary status of Gaza, “There is no clear consensus among Israeli political and military leadership about what should come next.” Still, he said, it is important to “have a plan for the day after.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Krause then evaluated the likelihood of several potential postmilitary outcomes, including Israel annexing Gaza, a mass expulsion of Gaza residents, or an Israeli resettlement of Gaza, all of which he regards as highly unlikely. Krause also suggested it is at least possible that Israel might develop a new buffer zone at the edge of Gaza, or even try West Bank-style mixed control of the area. It is still a bit more plausible, he offered, that Israel might continue a policy of ongoing strikes against Hamas in the area, even after its main military operations finish. Finally Krause noted, it is at least “in the realm of possibility” that Hamas could maintain power in Gaza, despite Israel’s stated aims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Krause suggested, some kind of modus vivendi&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is necessary, since “the Israelis and Palestinians are destined to live side by side in one form or another. Peace, security, and prosperity for one is significantly dependent on peace, security, and prosperity for the other. Strategies for the current conflict in Gaza and the broader Israeli-Palestinian relationship that reflect this realization at least have a chance of improving the situation over time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did Hamas choose to deliver this attack at this time, especially given the reprisals it has generated? In his remarks, Kirkpatrick discussed that issue based on recent reporting he has published in &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, particularly an interview with Mousa Abu Marzuk, a leader on the political side of Hamas’ operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirkpatrick emphasized that this reporting is simply to examine the stated thinking of those involved with Hamas, and does not imply any alignment with those views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Let’s be clear, there is no justification for the wanton killing of civilians, and I am in no way intending to at all justify the attack on October 7,” Kirkpatrick said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirkpatrick cited four factors Abu Marzuk mentioned while discussing the attacks: A sense that the situation of Palestinians has been overlooked globally, the dispute over the West Bank, control over the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, and a belief that largely Arab-populated countries have been less vocal in recent years in support of Palestinians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamas may have been further trying to establish itself as the sole leadership group of the Palestinian people, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s reasonable to think that an element of this was Palestinian politics, that what [Hamas was] hoping to do on that day was … to finish the erasure of the Palestinian Authority and to establish themselves as the strongest, the main, the last voice of the Palestinian people,” Kirkpatrick said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirkpatrick also recounted asking Abu Marzuk whether Hamas, in launching its attacks, regarded itself as acting from a position of strength or weakness. Abu Marzuk, Kirkpatrick stated, “tried to have it both ways,” emphasizing that Hamas was weaker than Israel overall, but had shown its capacities by fighting on Israel’s soil. However, Kirkpatrick said on Wednesday, discussing his own view about Abu Marzuk’s answer, “Obviously, I’m not convinced by that. This kind of violence seems to be much more evidence of weakness than strength. When you’re strong, you don’t need to kill civilians like that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kirkpatrick added that he thought renewed discussions of a two-state plan for Israelis and Palestinians were currently unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All in all, it is a very dark picture,” Kirkpatrick said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alshamary, in her comments, focused on the regional reaction to the war, connecting popular opinion to government responses. While most countries in the Middle East are not democracies, she noted, “they are still in a sense vulnerable to public pressure, and that has been mounting in recent weeks,” as pro-Palestinian protests have swelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different countries also have varying relationships with Israel, which — along with the extent of authoritarian control in a given country — helps explain their responses. Egypt and Jordan have formal diplomatic ties to Israel; as a result, Alshamary stated, Egypt has been positioning itself as a “mediator” to an extent. Jordan’s links to the U.S. mean some leadership statements decrying Israel’s military response have been a matter of “salvaging public opinion,” she added, while Turkey, which has a longer history of diplomatic relations with Israel, has been “riding a fine line” and seeking a balance in its public pronouncements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other countries in the Middle East have been calling for de-escalation of the war, Alshamary noted, including Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, and Sudan — which, along with Saudi Arabia, have recently been considering normalization of relations with Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, Alshamary said, she did not expect that to yield new steps toward a longer-term resolution of the situation. For instance, she suggested, Saudi Arabia “really hasn’t signaled dedication to using normalization as a tool to achieve any gains for the Palestinians.” Instead, she added, Saudi Arabia may well see normalization as something that will yield more gains for itself, from the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while some Middle East autocracies are relatively immune from public pressure, those with a greater need for support are bound to be sensitive to it, she observed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In the future, any steps that Arab leaders take toward Israel without a concurrent commitment to achieving gains for the Palestinians will be costly and likely publicly scrutinized,” Alshamary said. “This doesn’t mean an end to the peace process by any means, especially the one that has been envisioned, but I think we need to have a more frank discussion … about the likelihood of achieving [accords] in any meaningful and true and genuine way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon spoke to a greater extent about U.S. aims and actions, while acknowledging that there are clear limitations to the country’s influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The administration’s strategy is essentially crisis management,” Simon noted, while observing that the U.S. government “has little control, I think, at this point,” despite Israel and the U.S. being longtime allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, Simon noted, the U.S. foreign policy apparatus is also evaluating what might occur after this phase of Israel’s military operations conclude — and allowing for many possibilities, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The U.S. government now is just beginning to wrap its heads around the day after, and they’re thinking about this pretty carefully, without having drawn any conclusions,” Simon stated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon also noted that no one is actively pursuing the two-state peace process, which had its greatest momentum in the 1990s. Still, Simon outlined, there are hypothetical scenarios in which Israel could hand off control of Gaza to some kind of multilateral entity. But that scenario, or a handoff to the Palestinian Authority, he suggested, depends on the political orientation of the Israeli government that emerges from the crisis. In turn, he noted, the longer-term effects of the current crisis on Israeli public opinion are uncertain. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And without support inside and outside government, Simon concluded, a more enduring resolution “will not be possible.” In lieu of that, he added, in his view, “the future for Palestinians in Gaza, as well for Israelis, I believe, will be really rather dark.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Starr Forum event was part of MIT’s pursuit of open engagement and dialogue on difficult issues. After Oct. 7, MIT President Sally Kornbluth released a &lt;a href="https://president.mit.edu/writing-speeches/video-transcript-our-community-and-violence-israel-and-gaza" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; condemning the terror attacks. MIT’s Muslim and Jewish chaplains have also issued a joint statement calling for mutual respect among all on campus.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;All eyes were on the robot-dog pacing the hangar on Hanscom Air Force Base. The robot was just one technology, among small drones, autonomous mapping vehicles, and virtual-environment simulators, set up for military cadets to interact with. The goal was to open cadets' minds to possibilities. Over the next year, they will be applying such technologies to challenges facing the &lt;a href="https://www.socom.mil/"&gt;U.S. Special Operations Command&lt;/a&gt; (USSOCOM) for a program called &lt;a href="https://ignite.ll.mit.edu/ignite/"&gt;SOCOM Ignite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOCOM Ignite connects military students with research scientists and special operations forces to address SOCOM’s pressing technology challenges, while ushering in new generations of technology-savvy officers and operators. Now in its fourth year, the program invites cadets from across the nation’s military academies and Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) programs to participate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We started as just a two-day hackathon having less than 10 cadets, and now we are a year-long program with more than 80 cadets from more than 19 different universities, representing the Army, Navy, and Air Force. We hope to extend to the Marines and any other group out there," says Raoul Ouedraogo, who helped establish the program and is a leader within MIT Lincoln Laboratory’s Homeland Sensors and Analytics Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lincoln Laboratory researchers serve as the technical mentors in the program. To start the program this year, they offered new "innovation incubators," or crash courses on the basics of machine learning and autonomy, two topics of high interest to SOCOM. Following those sessions, a formal kick-off ceremony brought in SOCOM leaders to explain the impact of the program for the command’s mission. SOCOM is the nation’s only unified combatant command that oversees special operations forces across all branches of the armed services.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What makes SOCOM so important to the Department of Defense is that we are pathfinders. We look at advanced concepts, take those visions and dreams, and make them real," says SOCOM Senior Enlisted Leader (Retired) Greg Smith.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have a mix of academy cadets and ROTC students, providing diverse perspectives. We have access to users in the SOCOM community, whose time is precious, and to technology mentors, who do this for a living. Those three things make this a unique program," Lisa Sanders, the director of science and technology for Special Operations Forces, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, USSOCOM, said at the ceremony. "SOCOM also has acquisition authority — people who get ideas on the market. The ideas that you come up with will make a meaningful difference."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the opening ceremonies, the cadets traveled to the MIT campus for a weekend-long hackathon, which took place Sept. 16-17. At the hackathon, SOCOM operators presented more than a dozen Ignite challenges to the cadets. Cadets then formed teams to begin brainstorming concepts, working first-hand with special operations forces and laboratory technical experts to refine their ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges are diverse in their needs. One challenge is to develop a way to deploy air tags from small uncrewed air vehicles (UAVs) onto ground vehicles. Another is seeking algorithms and hardware to enhance autonomous UAV flight and mapping indoors. New this year, a biotechnology challenge calls for methods to improve the storage and delivery of blood in a tactical environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The hackathon experience was inspiring. It was great to see such a large number of cadets coming from different institutions attend and have a desire to conduct meaningful research," says Jack Perreault, a recent West Point graduate whose team is applying computer vision and speech recognition to the process of reporting and triaging casualties. "Getting insight on how our technical skills can help enable operators achieve their missions has left the greatest impact on me overall."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cadets will continue working on their concepts and receive funding to build prototypes throughout the school year. Over the winter, some might visit Fort Liberty, which houses the headquarters of the U.S. Army Special Operations Command, to showcase their solutions to users and update SOCOM leaders on their progress. In the spring, they’ll return to Lincoln Laboratory for final presentations. After that, Lincoln Laboratory and various SOCOM components will take on some cadets as interns or military fellows to continue their research. Perreault is one such military fellow, developing his SOCOM solution at the laboratory while pursuing a master's degree at Boston University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Air Force cadet Christopher Christmas is also continuing his work as a research assistant at the laboratory. A third-time SOCOM Ignite participant, he is pursuing a system that can ingest data from distributed sensors and generate useful information, sending it to the right people and in a scalable way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christmas recommends SOCOM Ignite to any cadet looking for an opportunity to make an impact. "It's an excellent leadership experience, exposing cadets to unique career fields and officers of various ranks. It has completely altered the trajectory of my life in the best way possible."&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Q&amp;A: The BRICS expansion and the global balance of power</title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2023/taylor-fravel-brics-expansion-0926</link>
  <description><![CDATA[MIT political scientist Taylor Fravel examines the potential and limitations of a bigger BRICS group of countries — and what it means for the U.S.]]></description>
  <pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2023 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2023/taylor-fravel-brics-expansion-0926</guid>
        <dc:creator>Peter Dizikes | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In early September, the BRICS group of countries with emerging economies — an informal alliance among Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa — announced it would expand its ranks by six nations. Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and UAE are now set to join the BRICS group in the near future. This would loosely link together countries representing about 30 percent of global GDP and 43 percent of global oil production, and some experts have speculated about further expansion of the group in the longer term. To discuss the BRICS development, &lt;/em&gt;MIT News&lt;em&gt; spoke with M. Taylor Fravel, an expert on China’s foreign policy and security strategy, who is the director of MIT’s Security Studies Program, as well as the Arthur and Ruth Sloan Professor in MIT’s Department of Political Science.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Why is the BRICS expansion happening now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; There’s been interest in expanding for a while. The BRICS primarily appeals to the relatively developed economies in the developing world. But there are huge differences in economic and military power within even the five current BRICS countries. What initially brought them together is the idea that they had shared interests, especially in the economic domain. At the same time, some of these countries have desired to increase their influence in the developing world. You can see how China, Russia, and India have been independently engaging Africa in the last decade. So they each have this desire, and then by acting together they may have more heft, perhaps as a grouping that can represent the interests of the developing world. However, the BRICS is not yet a formal international organization. The BRICS is not yet institutionalized, and I don’t know that it ever will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different states may have different motives for joining, too. For Iran, it gives them a lot more diplomatic space. Iran is a very interesting addition because it has been highly sanctioned by the United States, as Russia has been. That begs the question: What can BRICS do with the rest of the world? It may be more of a grouping that seeks to foster interactions among themselves, to enhance their heft vis-a-vis the world’s most advanced industrialized economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; On that note, given that BRICS is not formally institutionalized, what can it do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Below the level of their [public] statements, a lot of what the BRICS group can actually do remains uncertain. It’s a consensus-based grouping. The more members you add, and the more heterogenous their interests, the harder it will be to reach consensus. China may want to increase its diplomatic heft through the BRICS and maybe its security role in the developing world, whereas others may want to just focus on maximizing their economic interests. Those are very different impulses, which means the larger it gets, the more watered-down decisions or positions are likely to be, if it’s a group that operates by consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the purpose ultimately is to show the collective weight of this group such that their interests need to be taken into account by other states, especially in the West. And perhaps to serve as a vehicle to garner more support from the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What’s the trajectory for additional growth? Could there be more and more BRICS expansion, in coming years?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s hard to say. One way to think about it is the BRICS is now roughly the G20, but without many advanced industrial economies [and also] Turkey, Mexico, and Indonesia. The BRICS looks like a G20 minus. That suggests it could grow, but then the group becomes even more diffuse because within BRICS, China will have serious disputes with India over the border, and with Indonesia over maritime boundaries [if Indonesia joined]. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are also important security partners with the United States and large recipients of U.S. foreign military sales. Saudi Arabia and Iran, despite their recent rapprochement, have very significant differences. There seem to be a lot of issues that would limit what even the BRICS-plus could do, and even further limit what a BRICS-plus-plus could do if more countries are included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect it could become one of these groupings with annual summit meetings and meetings at different levels of government that will issue a lot of statements about their collective interests — that is not unimportant. It could also create the basis for creating something more substantial in the future. Yet because it has no secretariat, and the summit meetings are organized and shaped by the host country, the BRICS plus would not be a grouping that China could easily shape unless it was serving as the host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Speaking of which: How much is the BRICS expansion driven by China, and serving its interests?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; China is looking to carve out a much stronger leadership role beyond the OECD states, the advanced industrialized economies. There, I think it is approaching the limits of its diplomacy, especially as Europe becomes more concerned about the economic challenge it faces from China. Meanwhile China’s ties with the United States have never been more fractious, certainly since the end of the Cold War, if not since the normalization [of U.S.-China relations] that began in the 1970s. If China is looking for diplomatic support as ties with Europe and the E.U. deteriorate, the rest of the world beyond the OECD states is the place to go. But China is not putting all of its eggs in one basket, either. China is pursuing a diversified approach, including the BRICS, to see what might be most effective and to hedge its bets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, India also agreed to expand the BRICS, and India and China have a pretty frosty relationship at the moment. And Brazil agreed to expand, and they would like to deepen ties with the United States in the way that India would. All of that suggests there may be limits on how much China can drive the BRICS agenda to serve its own interests. But the BRICS could still pursue this broader goal of creating a sense of momentum around the wider economic interests these countries share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How should the U.S. respond, if at all? What kind of thinking is needed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; A BRICS as a diffuse grouping that is weakly institutionalized, if at all, does not pose a direct or serious threat to U.S. interests. At the same time, it probably underscores that the United States has neglected the interests of some of the states in the grouping. The U.S. has long under-invested in diplomacy as a way to pursue international influence. Yes, the United States has a tremendous amount of soft power despite this under-investment in diplomacy. But China now has more diplomatic missions abroad than the United States does — even though China has fewer bilateral relationships, because it doesn’t have ties with states that recognize Taiwan, and because China doesn’t have diplomatic missions to organizations like NATO and the OECD. Instead, the United States has relied on its military power and our economic heft while diplomacy has received less attention, especially within the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a reminder that the U.S. needs to think more about how it’s engaging the rest of the world in a way that advances the interests of both [itself and other countries]. I don’t view this as a zero-sum situation. It would be counterproductive for the United States to take a hostile approach to the BRICS, in part because it has friends within it. If you’re thinking strategtically, having friends in the BRICS group is not a bad thing, so a low-key response is probably most effective.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ultrasound that doesn’t require touching patients. A web-based tool that reinvents crew scheduling for the Air Force. Cryptographic hardware that protects sensitive data. And the world’s first practical memory for quantum networking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These four technologies developed at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, either wholly or with collaborators, received 2023 &lt;a href="https://www.rdworldonline.com/rd-100-winners-for-2023-are-announced-2/"&gt;R&amp;amp;D 100 Awards&lt;/a&gt;. The ultrasound technology also received a second award in a special category recognizing market-disrupting products. Bestowed by &lt;em&gt;R&amp;amp;D World&lt;/em&gt; magazine, the awards recognize the 100 most significant innovations that have transitioned to use or been made available for sale or license in the past year. The worldwide competition is judged by a panel of science and technology experts and industry professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Lincoln Laboratory has been very fortunate to receive 86 R&amp;amp;D 100 Awards over the past 14 years.&amp;nbsp;Our rate of unclassified technology transition continues to be very high, and we have a similar high transition rate for our classified programs.&amp;nbsp;The laboratory is truly changing the world through its successful technology development and transition. We congratulate everyone involved,” says Lincoln Laboratory Director Eric Evans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical imaging with noncontact ultrasound&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people are familiar with the ultrasound process — a sonographer presses a transducer onto a patient’s skin and moves it around, gathering images of tissues and organs. Though a well-established technology, ultrasound suffers from sonographer variability, making it difficult to accurately compare repeat measurements, and is limited by the need to make contact with the skin. For these reasons, magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography, despite their high costs and lack of portability, are still the predominant imaging technologies for disease tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/news/laser-based-system-achieves-noncontact-medical-ultrasound-imaging"&gt;Noncontact Laser Ultrasound (NCLUS) for Medical Imaging&lt;/a&gt; overcomes these limitations. The skin-safe laser system acquires ultrasound images without touching a patient. It uses a pulsed laser that emits optical energy, which is converted to ultrasound waves upon hitting tissue. The returning echoes are detected by a laser Doppler vibrometer and are processed to generate images. The system’s laser positioning on the body can be accurately reproduced, thus eliminating variability across repeated scans. This repeatability could enable ultrasound to be used to track disease progression, such as changes in tumor size over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its touchless design also opens up entirely new uses for ultrasound: “NCLUS could image burn or trauma victims, patients with open deep-tissue regions directly during surgery, premature infants requiring intensive medical care, patients with neck and spine injuries, and contagious individuals from standoff distances," says Robert Haupt, NCLUS co-inventor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With NCLUS, medical staff without sonography training might be able to perform ultrasound imaging outside of a hospital — in a doctor’s office, at home, or in a remote battlefield setting. Because of its game-changing potential in the medical imaging industry, NCLUS also received the R&amp;amp;D 100 Silver Medal in the Special Recognition: Market Disruptor Products category, in addition to the R&amp;amp;D 100 Award.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both awards are shared with the Massachusetts General Hospital Center for Ultrasound Research and Translation and Sound &amp;amp; Bright LLC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An optimizer for aircrew scheduling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Air Force has intense scheduling needs. Its fleet of C-17s, the cargo aircraft that transports troops and supplies globally, marked 4 million flight hours last year. Until recently, Air Force airmen, such as pilots and loadmasters, would have to schedule each flight’s crew manually, on a whiteboard. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/news/air-force-pilots-get-ai-assist-scheduling-aircrews"&gt;Puckboard&lt;/a&gt; has changed that. The web-based application provides intelligent, training-informed scheduling for the first time since military flight scheduling began about 80 years ago, and is returning valuable time back to airmen to focus on their primary duties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puckboard's collaborative tools provide schedulers with assignment recommendations while allowing crew members to volunteer for events that work best for their personal lives. Beyond providing a digital calendaring function, Puckboard applies artificial intelligence techniques that consider metrics such as crew training progression, flight-hour distribution, overqualification avoidance, and assignment fragility to recommend optimal schedules. Today, Puckboard hosts 24,000 users and has scheduled more than 315,000 events across 87 squadrons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Puckboard’s impact is a direct reflection of the breadth and depth of skill sets and sincere passion that all the contributors have. From the designers, software engineers, and algorithm experts to the active-duty squadrons and aircrew members, all the way up to senior leadership — everyone is committed to increasing the readiness of the U.S. Air Force through the lens of improving the quality of life of our airmen,” says Michael Snyder, a principal investigator on the project. “Scheduling is a complex topic, made even more difficult under uncertainty, and this effort is a testament to being able to solve any problem with the proper team.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This R&amp;amp;D 100 Award is shared with MIT, RevaComm, Department of the Air Force – MIT AI Accelerator, Air Force 15th Wing, 60th Air Mobility Wing, 437th Airlift Wing, Headquarters Air Mobility Command, Air Force Research Laboratory, assistant secretary of the Air Force (Installations, Environment, and Energy), and Raytheon-BBN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A device to secure data on uncrewed platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the U.S. military, the use of uncrewed systems is growing to minimize harm to human operators. Because these systems often transmit sensitive data over the air, their radio components must be certified by the National Security Agency (NSA). For years, this certification process has been an insurmountable hurdle for many small businesses and would-be innovators in radio technology and robotics from which the military could benefit. Now, such developers can use an already-NSA certified security solution, developed by Lincoln Laboratory, that’s ready to drop in and deploy for a wide variety of vehicles and missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Security/Cyber Module (SCM) End Cryptographic Unit (ECU) is a compact device that secures tactical datalinks of uncrewed systems. The module modernizes security by pulling together multiple cybersecurity technologies, most notably a technique called &lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/projects/tactical-key-management"&gt;Tactical Key Management&lt;/a&gt; that establishes secret keys on the fly for secure communication. The module is the first crypto device designed for a broad swath of uncrewed systems within the Joint Communication Architecture for Unmanned Systems (JCAUS), a recent U.S. Department of Defense effort to modularize uncrewed system radio links and allow reuse of NSA-certified components by standardizing capabilities and interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its delivery, the U.S. Navy has awarded a full-rate production contract to Tomahawk Robotics to supply SCM ECUs for use in their explosive ordnance disposal robots. “While developed primarily for Navy ground robotics, the SCM/ECU’s adherence to JCAUS ensures that it is well-suited to airborne and underwater vehicles alike,” says Ben Nahill, a principal investigator on the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The award is shared with the Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A scalable, photonic memory for quantum networking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In quantum information processing, memory receives and stores the state of a quantum bit (qubit), similar to how memory for an ordinary communication system or computer receives and stores information as binary states.&amp;nbsp;Memory makes it possible to reliably send and receive information between separate systems, even across lossy transmission links. Lincoln Laboratory’s quantum memory is the first to combine, in a single module, the three capabilities required for networking together separate quantum systems: a photonic interface, a way to correct for loss errors, and an architecture scalable to tens of memories in a single module. Until now, quantum memory systems have fallen short on one or more of these capabilities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This module eliminates many of the barriers to deploying quantum memories into real-world settings and test beds and to actually using them to develop emerging advanced quantum applications, such as distributed sensing and networked quantum processing,” says Ben Dixon, who leads this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A photonic interface allows for qubits to be transferred via particles of light (photons) between the memory and optical-fiber networks. The laboratory’s quantum memory uses silicon-vacancy (SiV) diamond color-centers, which are atom-like structures that can be efficiently manipulated with light, even at the single photon level. This SiV technology can also correct for signal-loss errors resulting from inefficient and lossy network links. Because it makes use of individual atomic color-centers, this technology is compatible with efficient "heralded" protocols, where a signal confirms the successful transmission of a photon across the network and storage of the associated qubit in memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SiV module is also scalable.&amp;nbsp;The SiV memory cells are integrated to a custom-made photonic integrated circuit, a technology that enables sending and receiving signals and can be scaled to hundreds of parallel channels. Combining this integration approach with a unique packaging architecture, laboratory researchers integrated eight quantum memories into a single module.&amp;nbsp;Additional memories can be integrated into this single module, which can be joined with additional modules for further scalability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these winning technologies, five other Lincoln Laboratory technologies were named R&amp;amp;D 100 award &lt;a href="https://www.rdworldonline.com/rd-100-finalists-for-2023-are-announced/"&gt;finalists&lt;/a&gt;. A gala celebrating the 2023 award winners will be held on Nov. 16 in San Diego, California.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although women’s wartime roles and agency tend to be neglected in conventional discourses on conflict, there are times when women not only take up arms but also shape the practices and policies of insurgent groups they fight for. Apekshya Prasai, a PhD candidate in MIT’s Department of Political Science, studies how rebel groups subvert entrenched patriarchal structures, ideas, and norms, and the role women play in this process. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All insurgents operate in, recruit from, and depend on communities where half the population is female,” says Prasai, a member of the Security Studies Program and an International Security Program research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center. “I find that when organizing rebellion, some insurgents strictly adhere to patriarchal gender norms while others challenge these norms in radical ways.” &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prasai has conducted extensive interview-based and archival fieldwork on leftist insurgencies across South Asia, especially the People’s War that unfolded in her native country of Nepal. Her work to date has already won significant notice. Most recently, she earned a Harry Frank Guggenheim Emerging Scholars Award, which recognizes promising doctoral work investigating urgent, present-day problems of violence. She has also received a Peace Scholar Dissertation Fellowship from the United States Institute of Peace as well as a grant from the National Science Foundation/American Political Science Association. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Rebel groups often regard questions around gender roles and relations to be central to their daily operations and long-term survival,” she says. “And the different ‘gender strategies’ they adopt can have implications for various important outcomes like cohesion, post-conflict gender politics, and effectiveness of rehabilitation and peace-building programs.” &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grounded in fieldwork&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advised by MIT political science professors Roger Petersen, Fotini Christia, and Vipin Narang, as well as Dara Kay Cohen, a public policy professor at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government, Prasai is writing a dissertation titled “Gendered Processes of Rebellion: Understanding Strategies for Organizing Violence.” Central to this work are original interviews with men and women who participated in the People’s War in Nepal (1996-2006) led by the Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist (CPN-M), which transitioned to civilian politics after laying down arms in 2006. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I spent nearly 17 months doing fieldwork, and it was my favorite part of the dissertation,” says Prasai. “I think I am happiest in the field, talking to people and learning from those who have first-hand experiences.” &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Born and raised in the capital city of Kathmandu, Prasai was still a child during the decade-long conflict. Although sheltered from the conflict, which largely unfolded further away from the capital in rural heartlands of country, Prasai’s academic pursuits have been shaped in important ways by her experiences growing up in Nepal. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The movement had a very big gender component, with CPN-M defying long-entrenched gender norms to, among other things, mobilize women as fighters and leaders,” she says. “Nepal being a patriarchal society, this was a puzzling outcome.” &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The social and political upheaval Prasai witnessed sparked her interest in the gender dimensions of conflict, first at Bowdoin College, and then at MIT. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As she began her studies Prasai was perplexed by a contradiction: Social science scholarship that generally portrayed women in conflict as victims of violence, activists of peace, or instrumentally used to serve male rebel leaders’ interests, and the reality of the women who not only participated in the Maoist movement in Nepal but through their engagement in conflict also emerged as key leaders shaping the post-conflict politics of Nepal. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conversations in Kathmandu&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determined to gain a better understanding of these complexities and contradictions, Prasai headed to Nepal to gather data, after just one semester as a graduate student.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of her fieldwork, she conducted 184 interviews with elite as well as rank-and-file men and women who participated in the movement in various roles, including combat. Her elite interviewees included the current Prime Minister of Nepal and leader of the armed movement, Pushpa Kamal Dahal (Prachanda), as well as almost all surviving members of the movement leadership and high-ranking female leaders. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The men and women I met were incredibly generous with their time and resources, several sharing wartime diaries, magazines, training manuals, songs, and pamphlets with me,” says Prasai. Some of the women she interviewed were post-conflict political leaders, others lived as civilians away from public scrutiny; many remained fierce advocates of gender equality, compelled by a vision of a more equitable world. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Female activists fighting for gender equality today were also theorizing about the relationship between gender equality and revolutionary politics and advocating for women during (and even before) the war,” says Prasai. “This internal advocacy work is a very important but overlooked mechanism that shapes the gender politics of &amp;nbsp;insurgent organizations,” she explains. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data Prasai has collected on armed movements in Nepal and across South Asia propels her dissertation’s novel theory — that “female activists’ internal, bottom-up resistance to and advocacy against patriarchal attitudes and practices gradually pushes rebel groups to subvert patriarchal norms in increasingly radical ways.” &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the emergence and effectiveness of such internal activism varies across contexts. Combined with the Maoist movement in Nepal, Prasai’s analysis of other leftist movements in South and Southeast Asia, especially the ongoing Maoist conflict in India, sheds light on the conditions that facilitate or obstruct such activism. In ideologically similar settings, Prasai finds, interaction among such factors as the type of rebel women’s wing, the extent of rebel dependence on traditional leaders, and the nature of violence deployed during conflict determines whether rebels conform to or radically challenge patriarchal gender norms. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy should account for rebel gender strategies&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Existing research suggests that the gender strategies rebels adopt can affect key conflict and post-conflict outcomes, says Prasai. She believes that the data and insights from her work can be relevant to policymakers seeking to devise more effective conflict management, peace-building, and gender policies and programs. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She hopes her insights might provide scholars and practitioners with “a more nuanced understanding of how rebel groups operate and how women exercise their agency to shape rebel behavior,” she says. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’d like to see political science scholarship on armed groups treat gender as central to the organization of violence rather than being a peripheral concern or an afterthought, and I’d like to see policymakers develop programs that are more congruent with realities on the ground as opposed to being rooted in whatever simplistic assumptions we may have about how violence operates and who fights and who cooks.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As she maps out the final leg of her doctoral journey, Prasai says she looks forward to a career devoted to uncovering the complex ways in which gender, violence, and politics shape the lives of people and trajectories of societies across South Asia. “My goal is to do rigorous research, grounded in fieldwork, reflective of peoples’ lived realities, and to translate what I find to academics and policymakers at a global level.” &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;How does Annabel Flores work to defeat a broken STEM pipeline while solving our country’s biggest aerospace and defense challenges? She uses a voice the MIT Leaders for Global Operations (LGO) program instilled in her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flores ’99, MBA ’03, SM ’03 is deputy president of land and air defense at Raytheon, an RTX company and prominent aerospace and defense firm. Flores’s life features, in her words, “a ton of meetings.” Each day is different, with a ceaseless balance between solving near-term tactical problems and completing long-term strategic tasks. Specifically, “we focus on designing, producing, delivering, and sustaining end-to-end capabilities to deter, defend, and defeat a wide range of threats that are critical to the defense of our country and partner nations,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flores is in her 17th job at the company, by her count. Her career history at Raytheon includes managing the strategic direction and operation of a diverse portfolio of electronic warfare products. “We deliver a full spectrum of land warfare sensors, helping our customers create layered and integrated air and missile defense. Our customers are predominantly the U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, and international land and air defense forces,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flores could easily go hoarse after so many meetings and presentations. But her experience in the MIT LGO program strengthened her voice. Knowing she became successful by learning to communicate, she sees value in presentation skills for leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Flores builds rapport with her teams in her own style because leadership “is not just about dollars and cents. It takes time and work to make it effective,” she asserts. The time spent communicating with people pushes progress on organizational goals, ensures clarity, and empowers enthusiastic ownership of the journey through all levels of the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flores recalls the safe space LGO provided for developing her public speaking skills. She’s thankful for the unique and specific feedback received from that core group of people that wanted the best for her. Without that advice, Flores believes, “I may not have advanced to where I am today. They’re the ones that started me down this path.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pencil skirts to briefcase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a child, Flores knew she wanted this life. “In third grade my mom bought me pencil skirts and matching shirts, but, man, I wanted a briefcase,” she remembers. A planner from the beginning, she decided she wanted to be an engineer sometime around seventh grade. “I had early dreams of getting into corporate America because that’s where they wore suits,” Flores recalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up in Texas, Flores dreamed of heading east to her dream school to do what women are sometimes told is impossible — become an engineer. Upon beginning her collegiate career at MIT, she saw firsthand what was possible by looking around her own mechanical engineering class, a class that was 42 percent female.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flores was in good company in undergraduate, but it was her time in the LGO program that instilled confidence in the engineer. After she graduated from MIT, Flores was determined to continue her plan with the doors opened by her mechanical engineering class. Her thesis’s focus was effective product development and speed-to-market. Her advisor pointed her toward the dual-degree MBA/MS LGO program, whose focus included product development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acceptance, she reminisced, “felt like going back home.” LGO presented an opportunity to consider the broader picture of product development and how to be an effective leader in that space. For example, the program was helping Flores build soft skills: team composition, change management, and motivating others. “I leverage these more in my career today than I would have expected,” said Flores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flores finally got her briefcase at Raytheon, an LGO industry partner, nearly 25 years ago. She started as an engineer, then realized she wanted to do more. On the way to her current executive role, Flores sought programs with growth opportunities. This was based on guidance from her LGO mentors at MIT. They charted the path to senior leadership: earn a breadth of experience from exposure to different customers, technologies, and problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From engineer to executive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the benefits available to Raytheon employees is the flexibility to take on different roles. Flores, taking full advantage, moved from engineering to business development, a change from developing technologies and products to a strict focus on customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She later took on another role in program leadership. When asked about the change, Flores admitted she “missed some of the engineering.” This new role involved both working with engineers to develop products and engaging directly with customers to ensure their needs were met. This perfect mix meant she could use her problem-solving skills and be a business leader, directing teams and making decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that she has the experience to offer mentorship and career guidance, Flores aligns her role at work with the opportunity to mentor people of diverse backgrounds as a senior advisor to LGO’s Underrepresented Minority Alumni Group. This &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/leading-industry-toward-sustainability-equity-janelle-heslop-0323"&gt;alumni affinity group&lt;/a&gt; raises awareness of this dual-degree program and how it can help accelerate careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flores has also partnered with National Academy Foundation (NAF) to build STEM training academies in high schools in Puerto Rico, Washington D.C., Texas, and Compton, California. She’s helping to design the curriculum, support teacher training, and bringing kids to Raytheon’s campus for mentorship and training opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is an honor to have Annabel and RTX support NAF, a national education nonprofit, which works to ensure high school students are future-ready, as we embark on this new chapter in establishing our footprint in Compton, CA,” said Elizabeth Perez, NAF chief partnership officer. “Along with our dedicated RTX volunteers, Annabel is committed to NAF’s work-based learning efforts, which are invaluable to preparing the next generation of leaders, through hands-on activities, mentorships, and more. These experiences yield powerful connections and help students to develop the necessary skills to succeed and take their next steps after high school&amp;nbsp;— no matter where their paths may lead.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building a STEM pipeline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Raytheon, “we provide community support through efforts such as food scarcity programs, supporting people who leave the military through career fairs, jobs, and community-related activities, and building a STEM pipeline,” Flores says, beaming. Such projects reflect a desire to serve the public in a way that remains authentic to the company’s identity, and to Flores’s personal goals to further educational opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flores wants kids to move from elementary school through college interested in and committed to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs. Raytheon commits to kids’ futures by providing high school internships, fulfilling Flores’s desire to give young people the kinds of opportunities she had in the MIT Leaders for Global Operations program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alumni connections she has now are still willing to share leadership lessons. “This type of positive environment is not easy to find,” Flores notes. Laura Bogusch SM ’03, an LGO classmate of Flores who is now vice president at Boeing, says, “One of the best things to come from my Leaders for Manufacturing [LGO] experience was the connections with the women in our class. It is rare to have a group of friends who are able to relate to both me and my career in this way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further emphasizing the program’s value beyond graduation, Flores remarks, “I’m in the same place for them. I never felt competitiveness. Once you strip that one-upness it changes everything, which is the enduring strength of what LGO has built. Watching [alumni] do amazing things makes you want to do amazing things. They shape the art of what’s possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>A new dataset of Arctic images will spur artificial intelligence research</title>

    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2023/new-dataset-arctic-images-will-spur-artificial-intelligence-research-0724</guid>
        <dc:creator>Kylie Foy | MIT Lincoln Laboratory</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) icebreaker &lt;a href="https://www.pacificarea.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/Cutters/cgcHealy/"&gt;Healy&lt;/a&gt; takes part in a voyage across the North Pole this summer, it is capturing images of the Arctic to further the study of this rapidly changing region. Lincoln Laboratory researchers installed a camera system aboard the Healy while at port in Seattle before it embarked on a three-month science mission on July 11. The resulting dataset, which will be one of the first of its kind, will be used to develop artificial intelligence tools that can analyze Arctic imagery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This dataset not only can help mariners navigate more safely and operate more efficiently, but also help protect our nation by providing critical maritime domain awareness and an improved understanding of how AI analysis can be brought to bear in this challenging and unique environment," says Jo Kurucar, a researcher in Lincoln Laboratory's &lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/homeland-protection/artificial-intelligence-software-architectures-and-algorithms"&gt;AI Software Architectures and Algorithms Group&lt;/a&gt;, which led this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the planet warms and sea ice melts, Arctic passages are opening up to more traffic, both to military vessels and ships conducting illegal fishing. These movements may pose national security challenges to the United States. The opening Arctic also leaves questions about how its climate, wildlife, and geography are changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, very few imagery datasets of the Arctic exist to study these changes. Overhead images from satellites or aircraft can only provide limited information about the environment. An outward-looking camera attached to a ship can capture more details of the setting and different angles of objects, such as other ships, in the scene. These types of images can then be used to train AI computer-vision tools, which can help the USCG plan naval missions and automate analysis. According to Kurucar, USCG assets in the Arctic are &lt;a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2928402/us-needs-more-icebreakers-for-arctic/"&gt;spread thin&lt;/a&gt; and can benefit greatly from AI tools, which can act as a force multiplier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Healy is the USCG's largest and most technologically advanced icebreaker. Given its current mission, it was a fitting candidate to be equipped with a new sensor to gather this dataset. The laboratory research team collaborated with the USCG &lt;a href="https://www.dcms.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/Assistant-Commandant-for-Acquisitions-CG-9/Research-Development-Test-and-Evaluation/Research-and-Development-Center/"&gt;Research and Development Center&lt;/a&gt; to determine the sensor requirements. Together, they developed the Cold Region Imaging and Surveillance Platform (CRISP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Lincoln Laboratory has an excellent relationship with the Coast Guard, especially with the Research and Development Center. Over a decade, we’ve established ties that enabled the deployment of the CRISP system," says Amna Greaves, the CRISP project lead and an assistant leader in the AI Software Architectures and Algorithms Group. "We have strong ties not only because of the USCG veterans working at the laboratory and in our group, but also because our technology missions are complementary. Today it was deploying infrared sensing in the Arctic; tomorrow it could be operating quadruped robot dogs on a fast-response cutter."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CRISP system comprises a long-wave infrared camera, manufactured by Teledyne FLIR (for forward-looking infrared), that is designed for harsh maritime environments. The camera can stabilize itself during rough seas and image in complete darkness, fog, and glare. It is paired with a GPS-enabled time-synchronized clock and a network video recorder to record both video and still imagery along with GPS-positional data. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camera is mounted at the front of the ship's fly bridge, and the electronics are housed in a ruggedized rack on the bridge. The system can be operated manually from the bridge or be placed into an autonomous surveillance mode, in which it slowly pans back and forth, recording 15 minutes of video every three hours and a still image once every 15 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The installation of the equipment was a unique and fun experience. As with any good project, our expectations going into the install did not meet reality," says Michael Emily, the project's IT systems administrator who traveled to Seattle for the install. Working with the ship's crew, the laboratory team had to quickly adjust their route for running cables from the camera to the observation station after they discovered that the expected access points weren't in fact accessible. "We had 100-foot cables made for this project just in case of this type of scenario, which was a good thing because we only had a few inches to spare," Emily says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CRISP project team plans to publicly release the dataset, anticipated to be about 4 terabytes in size, once the USCG science mission concludes in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal in releasing the dataset is to enable the wider research community to develop better tools for those operating in the Arctic, especially as this region becomes more navigable. "Collecting and publishing the data allows for faster and greater progress than what we could accomplish on our own," Kurucar adds. "It also enables the laboratory to engage in more advanced AI applications while others make more incremental advances using the dataset."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of providing the dataset, the laboratory team plans to provide a baseline object-detection model, from which others can make progress on their own models. More advanced AI applications planned for development are classifiers for specific objects in the scene and the ability to identify and track objects across images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond assisting with USCG missions, this project could create an influential dataset for researchers looking to apply AI to data from the Arctic to help combat climate change, says Paul Metzger, who leads the AI Software Architectures and Algorithms Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metzger adds that the group was honored to be a part of this project and is excited to see the advances that come from applying AI to novel challenges facing the United States: “I’m extremely proud of how our group applies AI to the highest-priority challenges in our nation, from predicting outbreaks of Covid-19 and assisting the U.S. European Command in their support of Ukraine to now employing AI in the Arctic for maritime awareness."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the dataset is available, it will be free to download on the Lincoln Laboratory dataset&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/datasets"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Educating national security leaders on artificial intelligence</title>

  <description><![CDATA[Experts from MIT’s School of Engineering, Schwarzman College of Computing, and Sloan Executive Education educate national security leaders in AI fundamentals.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Mary Beth Gallagher | School of Engineering</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding artificial intelligence and how it relates to matters of national security has become a top priority for military and government leaders in recent years. A new three-day custom program entitled “Artificial Intelligence for National Security Leaders”&amp;nbsp;— AI4NSL for short&amp;nbsp;— aims to educate leaders who may not have a technical background on the basics of AI, machine learning, and data science, and how these topics intersect with national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“National security fundamentally is about two things: getting information out of sensors and processing that information. These are two things that AI excels at. The AI4NSL class engages national security leaders in understanding how to navigate the benefits and opportunities that AI affords, while also understanding its potential negative consequences,” says Aleksander Madry, the Cadence Design Systems Professor at MIT and one of the course’s faculty directors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organized jointly by MIT’s School of Engineering, MIT Stephen A. Schwarzman College of Computing, and MIT Sloan Executive Education, AI4NSL wrapped up its fifth cohort in April. The course brings leaders from every branch of the U.S. military, as well as some foreign military leaders from NATO, to MIT’s campus, where they learn from faculty experts on a variety of technical topics in AI, as well as how to navigate organizational challenges that arise in this context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We set out to put together a real executive education class on AI for senior national security leaders,” says Madry. “For three days, we are teaching these leaders not only an understanding of what this technology is about, but also how to best adopt these technologies organizationally.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original idea sprang from discussions with senior U.S. Air Force (USAF) leaders and members of the Department of the Air Force (DAF)-MIT AI Accelerator in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Major John Radovan, former deputy director of the DAF-MIT AI Accelerator, in recent years it has become clear that national security leaders needed a deeper understanding of AI technologies and its implications on security, warfare, and military operations. In February 2020, Radovan and his team at the DAF-MIT AI Accelerator started building a custom course to help guide senior leaders in their discussions about AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is the only course out there that is focused on AI specifically for national security,” says Radovan. “We didn’t want to make this course just for members of the Air Force — it had to be for all branches of the military. If we are going to operate as a joint force, we need to have the same vocabulary and the same mental models about how to use this technology.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a pilot program in collaboration with MIT Open Learning and the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Radovan connected with faculty at the School of Engineering and MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, including Madry, to refine the course’s curriculum. They enlisted the help of colleagues and faculty at MIT Sloan Executive Education to refine the class’s curriculum and cater the content to its audience. The result of this cross-school collaboration was a new iteration of AI4NSL, which was launched last summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing participants with a basic overview of AI technologies, the course places a heavy emphasis on organizational planning and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What we wanted to do was to create smart consumers at the command level. The idea was to present this content at a higher level so that people could understand the key frameworks, which will guide their thinking around the use and adoption of this material,” says Roberto Fernandez, the William F. Pounds Professor of Management and one of the AI4NSL instructors, as well as the other course’s faculty director.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the three-day course, instructors from MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and MIT Sloan School of Management cover a wide range of topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first half of the course starts with a basic overview of concepts including AI, machine learning, deep learning, and the role of data. Instructors also present the problems and pitfalls of using AI technologies, including the potential for adversarial manipulation of machine learning systems, privacy challenges, and ethical considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the middle of day two, the course shifts to examine the organizational perspective, encouraging participants to consider how to effectively implement these technologies in their own units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What’s exciting about this course is the way it is formatted first in terms of understanding AI, machine learning, what data is, and how data feeds AI, and then giving participants a framework to go back to their units and build a strategy to make this work,” says Colonel Michelle Goyette, director of the Army Strategic Education Program at the Army War College and an AI4NSL participant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the course, breakout sessions provide participants with an opportunity to collaborate and problem-solve on an exercise together. These breakout sessions build upon one another as the participants are exposed to new concepts related to AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The breakout sessions have been distinctive because they force you to establish relationships with people you don’t know, so the networking aspect is key. Any time you can do more than receive information and actually get into the application of what you were taught, that really enhances the learning environment,” says Lieutenant General Brian Robinson, the commander of Air Education and Training Command for the USAF and an AI4NSL participant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This spirit of teamwork, collaboration, and bringing together individuals from different backgrounds permeates the three-day program. The AI4NSL classroom not only brings together national security leaders from all branches of the military, it also brings together faculty from three schools across MIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One of the things that's most exciting about this program is the kind of overarching theme of collaboration,” says Rob Dietel, director of executive programs at Sloan School of Management. “We're not drawing just from the MIT Sloan faculty, we're bringing in top faculty from the Schwarzman College of Computing and the School of Engineering. It's wonderful to be able to tap into those resources that are here on MIT’s campus to really make it the most impactful program that we can.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As new developments in generative AI, such as ChatGPT, and machine learning alter the national security landscape, the organizers at AI4NSL will continue to update the curriculum to ensure it is preparing leaders to understand the implications for their respective units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The rate of change for AI and national security is so fast right now that it's challenging to keep up, and that's part of the reason we've designed this program. We've brought in some of our world-class faculty from different parts of MIT to really address the changing dynamic of AI,” adds Dietel.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Suzanne Freeman and Mariel Garcia-Montes are the recipients of this year’s Jeanne Guillemin Prize at the Center for International Studies (CIS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prize&amp;nbsp;provides financial support to women studying international affairs, a field that has long been dominated by men. Jeanne Guillemin, a veteran colleague at CIS, endowed the fund shortly before her death in 2019. An authority on biological warfare, one of her important investigations exposed the Soviet Union’s role in the 1979 lethal anthrax outbreak in the city of Sverdlovsk, now Yekaterinburg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As a woman who studies the Soviet Union and Russia today, it is especially meaningful to get this award,” says Freeman, who is a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science, and a student at the Security Studies Program (SSP) where Guillemin had served as a senior advisor. “Dr. Guillemin was a trailblazer for women, international security, and also someone who shared an interest in the region that I study, including the abuses of justice in the Soviet government.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garcia-Montes, a student in the doctoral program in History, Anthropology, Science, Technology and Society (HASTS), described special significance, too, in being awarded the prize: “I’m really moved to be a recipient of the Jeanne Guillemin prize because of her contribution to international affairs research, but also because of the origins of the prize — to help support women in academia. As I reflect on the past decade that has shaped my research project, there have been a lot of women in academia who have really been there for me, mentoring me and helping me face the challenges women in academia face. I’m so grateful to be a part of this legacy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spying on&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the KGB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freeman will apply the funds toward her dissertation research on the role of authoritarian intelligence organizations in shaping foreign policy agendas within their states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her case studies look at the KGB and its successor organizations — the FSB and SVR — and how they influenced national security decisions made by Russia and the former Soviet Union dating back to the Cold War era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Because the KGB held so much sway within the Soviet Union, it's a unique opportunity to look at a very powerful intelligence organization and to build a theory on this type of activity. Most of the available research looks only at intelligence agencies within democratic nations — like the United States and the United Kingdom — where there are constitutional checks and balances that don’t exist within autocratic countries,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fieldwork has landed her in Poland and Lithuania to mine primary data now available in those nations’ archives. She has also gained access to documents from Russia — although unable to travel there since its invasion of Ukraine — through the U.S. Library of Congress and Stanford University’s Hoover Library and Archive. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her academic sleuthing allows her to eavesdrop on KGB communications to other intelligence agencies and to its own heads of state during national security crises of historical significance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some instances, these communications resulted in alliances, such as the Indo-Soviet Friendship and Cooperation Treaty in 1971; in more aggressive behavior, such as the Soviet-Afghanistan war in 1979; and in no military action at all, such as the anti-Communist solidarity protests in Poland in the 1980s. But why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her research will help provide a better understanding of these kinds of foreign policy decisions, and the strategies employed by autocratic intelligence organizations to influence government leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could also provide insights into how today’s authoritarian regimes respond to perceived threats on national security issues, including the current war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We will never be able to read the minds of authoritarian leaders, but we can gain a clear historical understanding of how autocratic intelligence organizations, such as the KGB, have either shared select information or taken initiative in intelligence operations to serve their own preferences of national security.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital technology and social justice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Power and political events are entangled in our tools,” explains Garcia-Montes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her dissertation research focuses on digital technology and its impact on privacy and information security across disparate societies, especially in her home country of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This includes everything from government-sponsored surveillance on specific individuals to more everyday cultures of surveillance that are inherent in the digital tools we use in the workplace and our personal lives,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexico’s use of the spyware Pegasus is one of the subjects of her case study. The surveillance tool was developed in 2011 by an Israeli cyber-arms company with the intended goal of being used by authorized countries to combat terror and crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pegasus is now under global legal investigations, including in the United States and the European Union, for its nefarious deployment by oppressive regimes and criminal organizations. Egregious human rights violations have been committed against journalists, government officials, and activists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What makes Mexico’s use of Pegasus important is that it shows the perils of a surveillance technology that is intended to increase national security by governments with democratic ideals. But, as we see in Mexico, such a technology can become easily exploited in a nation that seemingly fits that description but has very little oversight regarding surveillance acquisition.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexico was the first country to purchase and the most prolific user of Pegasus. The abuse of the malware ignited a wave of activism and advocacy and governmental awareness, both in Mexico and worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A line had been crossed even for a country that had pretty much normalized surveillance, explains Garcia-Montes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is not a random story. It all started because a coalition of researchers and activists — many of whom were targets of the malware — took the steps to find out how and why this happened. Thanks to their work, governments have blacklisted Pegasus and there is much more discussion around cyber arms and especially surveillance malware,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from Pegasus, her work analyzes other contemporary projects such as the deployment of biometric technologies for identification, and workplace surveillance through productivity suites. She is also building on a longer legacy of surveillance, which she studies through a historical lens at the secret police collection in Mexico’s National Archive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A global map and a great tsunami&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An “aha!” moment at a young age led to what Freeman and Garcia-Montes describe today as a linear academic path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Freeman, who grew up in Boston during the 1990s, the dissolution of the Soviet Union became a curiosity in primary school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The world maps in our social studies classes still had the Soviet Union represented as one state. I asked a lot of questions about what exactly happened here, and why. But I never got a clear answer from my teachers. This really made me want to learn more and solve that puzzle myself,” says Freeman, who originally envisioned becoming a Russian historian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an undergraduate student at Columbia University, she realized that political science, instead, was her field of interest. She wrote her thesis on Russian military reform and went on to get her master’s degree at Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs. She then worked as a researcher at the Russia Maritime Studies Institute at the U.S. Naval War College, and as an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She credits Kimberly Marten and Austin Long PhD '10, both of whom were her professors while she was at Columbia, and Olga Oliker PhD '16, under whom she worked at CSIS, for cultivating her research interests and planting the seeds for her PhD thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also strongly recommended MIT, and specifically SSP where both Long and Oliker studied, as the ideal home for her doctorate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SSP’s research and teaching staff is comprised of social scientists and policy analysts who focus on national and international security problems and is among the world’s leading graduate education programs in its field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“At MIT, there is a large community of doctoral students and faculty who are focusing on both security studies and comparative politics, which aligns with my research areas in a unique way that I couldn’t find anywhere else,” says Freeman, who is among a supportive cohort of graduate students at SSP, which is based at CIS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freeman also co-leads the Working Group on Women in International Politics and Security at CIS. The group, co-founded by Guillemin and her SSP colleague Cindy Williams during their early years at CIS, builds networks with researchers who work on international security issues and who share an interest in advancing opportunities for women in this field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garcia-Montes first became aware of the ways inequality plays out in digital technologies during junior high school in Mexico City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There was a great tsunami in Asia and I was interacting online with peers around the globe. It dawned on me then that most of my classmates had no idea what had just happened. I was one of the few middle school students that had access to a digital space where teenagers were discussing this in real time. Our use of technology was different. Mine came with privilege. So I wanted to use my time to level this space. Seventeen years later, I end up writing about one the biggest displays of digital inequality in my country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After receiving a bachelor's degree in philosophy from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Garcia began doing research in open data, privacy and security, strategic communications, and other digital literacies for organizations in Mexico, the United States, and around the world. This included places like UNICEF, Wikimedia Foundation, Internews, and the Latin American Initiative on Open Data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She first came to MIT to study at the MIT Comparative Media Studies program. There she received her master’s and found inspiration from — and a kindred academic spirit with — Sasha Costanza-Chock, who studies networked social movements, transformative media organizing, and design justice. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at HASTS, she finds inspiration in her advisors’ work to study political processes through the study of science and technology, including: Eden Medina,&amp;nbsp;associate professor of science, technology, and society; Tanalís Padilla, professor of history; Héctor Beltrán, assistant professor of anthropology; and Will Deringer, associate professor of science, technology, and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Catherine D'Ignazio, an associate professor in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning, is also among her academic role models. D’Ignazio directs the Data + Feminism Lab, where Garcia-Montes is a research affiliate. Garcia-Montes is also a member of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University, where she finds a community of like-minded scholars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT was the only place in the world she wanted to study — she wants to make that clear. It offers her an opportunity to understand what she describes as the people side, the artifact side, and the objects at the center of her research. Something she believes she could only do at a place like MIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m in a space where I’m encouraged to exercise my right to think. I want to express my heartfelt thanks to all the professors in HASTS and at the School of Humanities and Social Sciences that foster this kind of space. I’ll always be a HASTS and SHASS fangirl.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:creator>Kimberly Tecce | Rachel Gordon | Department of Mechanical Engineering | MIT CSAIL</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) recently announced the recipients of its Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) awards for 2023. This year, MIT Department of Mechanical Engineering (MechE) professors George Barbasthasis and John Hart, MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) Assistant Professor Pulkit Agrawal, and MIT Department of Materials Science and Engineering Associate Professor&amp;nbsp;Rob Macfarlane are principal investigators on projects selected for MURI Awards. Two others from MIT — Ila Fiete, a professor in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, and Aude Oliva, MIT director of the MIT–IBM Watson AI Lab, director of strategic industry engagement in the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, and a senior research scientist at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) — will be participating in these projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, three MURI projects led by faculty at other institutions will be collaborating with other MIT researchers. The 2023 MURI awards total $220 million and will fund &lt;a href="https://media.defense.gov/2023/Mar/21/2003183593/-1/-1/1/FISCAL-YEAR-2023-RESEARCH-FUNDING-AWARDS.PDF" target="_blank"&gt;31 research projects&lt;/a&gt; at an extensive list of institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MURI program is designed to support research in areas of critical importance to national defense, and brings together teams of researchers from multiple universities to collaborate on projects that are expected to lead to significant advances in science and technology. The program is highly competitive, with only a small fraction of proposals receiving funding each year, and it has a strong track record of supporting research that has led to breakthroughs in fields ranging from materials science to information technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fundamental limits of nanoscale X-ray microscopy in radiation-sensitive materials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Default"&gt;One of the funded projects is titled “Searching for what’s new: the systematic development of dynamic X‐ray microscopy.” This will be led by Professor George Barbastathis of MechE, alongside colleagues from Northwestern University and Stony Brook University, and falls within the Fundamental Limits of Nanoscale X-ray Microscopy in Radiation Sensitive Materials MURI topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Default"&gt;Barbastathis and his team explain that X-ray microscopes offer unique capabilities, but can also be harmful to the small objects they’re taking images of. This team has developed a new approach that puts forward a paradigm shift for higher resolution and the study of dynamics, allowing one to start with knowledge they already have of a specific object, rather than a blank slate. This should allow them to use less harmful X-ray exposures. The team plans to test this approach to study three model systems: small machines, batteries, and cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Default"&gt;This project is sponsored by the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research and will help the DoD by providing new insights into the function of batteries used in troop-carried electronics, aircraft, and elsewhere; in the response of micro electronic mechanical systems, which are used in the field as sensors; and in the biological response of cells to external stresses and environmental changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Default"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spatially programmed material properties via designed mesostructures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Default"&gt;John Hart and&amp;nbsp;Rob Macfarlane are co-leading a MURI project entitled “Directed assembly of mesoscale architectures in additive manufacturing,” sponsored by the U.S. Office of Naval Research. The project is in collaboration with professors A.J. Boydston of the University of Wisconsin; Randall Erb and Safa Jamali of Northeastern University; and Arthi Jayaraman of the University of Delaware. The team’s expertise spans chemistry, materials science, simulation, machine learning, machine design, and characterization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Default"&gt;While additive manufacturing can create complex geometries from a wide variety of materials, it is typically not possible to control the architecture of the material at a length scale smaller than the resolution of the additive process. The MURI team will combine additive manufacturing with “bottom-up” directed assembly, using tailored nanoparticle building blocks and polymers, and by building new instruments to study the process and validate computational predictions. The end goal of the project is to realize materials and structures with emergent thermal electromagnetic, and optical properties that could be used in, for instance, cooling of high-power electronics, next-generation communication systems, and high-performance cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuro‐inspired distributed deep learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pulkit Agrawal, assistant professor in EECS and an affiliate of CSAIL and the MIT Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS), leads a third MURI project. Agrawal's team, which includes Ila Fiete and Aude Oliva of MIT as well as researchers from Harvard University and the University of California at Berkeley, proposes an alternative to the mainstream machine-learning practice of condensing large datasets into the weights of deep neural network and discarding the training data itself. Such an approach has fundamental limitations when it comes to lifelong learning and the associated questions of generalization, long-term reasoning, and catastrophic forgetting. As such, the proposal suggests avoiding compressing data ahead of time and instead combining data on-the-fly for the environment or task encountered by the agent, using memory retrieval to improve generalization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The work aims to articulate a set of high-level computational principles for the design of memory systems, leveraging knowledge about how the brain encodes and retrieves information from memory. It aims to determine how these principles can be leveraged to tackle challenging machine learning tasks, understand how biological memory systems represent and retrieve naturalistic inputs, and help in the integration of AI into a wide variety of real-world systems. Ideally, the end result will yield practical algorithms for generalization to new tasks, lifelong learning without catastrophic forgetting, and transfer across sensory modalities.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>A transformative era ends at the Center for International Studies</title>

  <description><![CDATA[Richard J. Samuels steps down as director; Evan Lieberman is named his successor.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the early 1980s, Richard Samuels PhD ’80 was an assistant professor in the Department of Political Science, specializing in Japanese politics and public policy. With the rapid emergence of Japan as a global economic powerhouse, Samuels, now the director of the Center for International Studies (CIS) and Ford International Professor of Political Science, had realized that “only by working and learning abroad, will MIT scientists and engineers fully appreciate that not all the world’s science and engineering starts and ends in 02139,” he recalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This insight sparked the MIT-Japan Program in 1982, an entirely new approach to international undergraduate education that emphasized Japanese language study and hands-on application of expertise in companies and university laboratories in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samuels’s novel concept of “applied international studies” lit a fire. With his support, additional programs were created for China and India, paving the way for MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives (MISTI), which at last count provided opportunities for nearly 1,000 students a year to research and collaborate in 20 nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MISTI exemplifies Samuels’s larger enterprise at CIS to make international scholarship and experience not just relevant, but essential, across the Institute and beyond. He has broadened the center’s scope, embracing education and public outreach, while deepening its storied roots in security studies and research in science and technology policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of June, after a two-decade tenure at CIS, Samuels plans to step down. He will remain an active faculty member in the Department of Political Science and its Security Studies Program. Evan Lieberman, the Total Professor of Political Science and Contemporary Africa and current director of MISTI, will take on the leadership of CIS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The orchestra conductor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the eve of his departure, colleagues reflected on the evolution of CIS under Samuels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dick has been a wonderful promoter of good ideas, always getting behind the efforts of his colleagues,” says Suzanne Berger, Institute professor, who led the MIT-China and MIT-France Programs, and was a founding director of MISTI. “He’s like an orchestra conductor, building off of people with deep interests and capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Bish Sanyal, the Ford International Professor of Urban Development and Planning and CIS research member, Samuels played an integral role in bringing to fruition a 2007 project, “Just Jerusalem: Visions for a Place of Peace,” spearheaded by Sanyal and Diane Davis, then associate dean of the School of Architecture and Planning. “CIS, under Dick’s leadership, supported the Department of Urban Studies and Planning-led campus wide effort to envision what Jerusalem could be as a city,” says Sanyal.&amp;nbsp; A design competition, “Just Jerusalem” invited entrants to imagine ways of bridging differences by addressing the physical, economic, civic, or symbolic infrastructure of the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to M. Taylor Fravel, the Arthur and Ruth Sloan Professor of Political Science and recently appointed director of the MIT Security Studies Program (SSP), CIS has served “as a welcoming incubator for new programs.” SSP, which began in the Cold War as the Defense and Arms Control Studies program, has “grown significantly under Samuels’s leadership of CIS,” says Fravel, an expert on China, East Asia, and international relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One major venture Fravel cites is the Robert E. Wilhelm Fellows Program, begun by Samuels through a gift from an MIT alumnus. This program supports a year-long engagement at CIS by an individual who has held senior public policy positions, giving center researchers direct access to an authoritative figure working on problems in their area. “In security studies, we’ve had the ability to interact with a terrific group of people in the national security space,” says Fravel. In recent years, fellows have included the former commander of the Pacific Fleet and a head of U.S. counterintelligence under the director of national intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fravel credits Samuels in part for identifying the need for deep expertise in Asia and helping establish a group of tenured faculty “on all the major actors that bear on national security there.” This includes Samuels, Fravel, and Vipin Narang, the Frank Stanton Professor of Nuclear Security and Political Science (and currently principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for space policy), as well as Eric Heginbotham, an alumnus with China and Japan expertise whom he enticed to return to MIT as a principal research scientist at the center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fravel also noted “the build-out of the Starr Forum series,” a public event series bringing major policymakers and scholars to MIT to discuss pressing international issues of the day. “The forum has been very nimble in putting on programs quickly and effectively,” he says. Topics in the first few months of 2023 included discussions of the struggle for normalcy by women in Iran and the consequences of the Ukraine-Russia war on domestic life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the pandemic, the forum drew large in-person crowds, and now, “with a hybrid format, many hundreds more have been able to participate and learn from these events,” says Fravel. “CIS has become a central node for discussion of pressing, contemporary challenges in international politics.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk to the public&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Samuels denies pursuing a grand vision, he admits that he “wanted to broaden CIS, to get social scientists not just talking to each other but to the public, sharing what they have learned, and making a mark in the real world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His modus operandi was to “find support for the remarkable faculty and students of MIT and then get out of the way,” he says. But the cluster of CIS programs that emerged on his watch — on human rights and technology and international migration, for instance — attests to his desire and determination to make the research and perspectives of center scholars known for their expertise on some of the most significant global problems of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One CIS project with great personal meaning for Samuels is the Elizabeth Neuffer Fellowship, named for a friend, a &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; journalist who died in Iraq in 2003. The fellowship, conducted in partnership with the International Women’s Media Foundation, provides women and nonbinary journalists from around the world with an opportunity to spend seven months at MIT, the &lt;em&gt;Globe&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, focusing on human rights and social justice issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As wide-ranging as these CIS projects are, Berger and other longtime colleagues see MISTI as Samuels’s signal accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He planted a seed that blossomed into something incredibly impactful,” says MISTI Executive Director April Julich Perez, who first met Samuels during a visit with the French consulate in Boston, where she was working as assistant cultural attachée to discuss connections between MIT and France. Julich Perez notes that Samuels was more than a generative force behind the MISTI student programs. “He launched the MISTI Global Seed Fund program, which awards $2.5 million a year to MIT faculty to work with researchers on complementary projects in dozens of countries.” A majority of MIT faculty have applied for seed funds, she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MISTI is now so mainstream at MIT that engineering and science faculty are signing up to be academic leads on undergraduate programs in different countries, replacing social science and humanities colleagues who historically held those roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The MISTI model has fundamentally transformed MIT education,” says Berger. “Samuels found a way of interesting a majority of faculty and students who are intensely focused on technology in international life and learning, positioning the Center for International Studies in a way that has made it uniquely valuable within MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The next chapter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 1, Evan Lieberman will pick up the CIS baton from Samuels, who is happily anticipating resuming a book on political kidnapping he set aside in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dick Samuels built the CIS into a vibrant incubator of ideas, an engine of scholarly output and policy relevance, and a place where fierce debates could occur while friendships were forged. This is the institution that Evan Lieberman, one of the department’s most creative and entrepreneurial members, will soon take in exciting new directions,” says David Singer, head of the Department of Political Science and Raphael Dorman-Helen Starbuck Professor of Political Science&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lieberman joined MIT in 2014 as the Total Professor of Political Science and Contemporary Africa. Prior to that, he served as a tenured professor and associate chair in the Department of Politics at Princeton University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He brings to CIS a rich portfolio, including his dedication to international education. In 2021, he was named faculty director of &lt;a href="https://misti.mit.edu" target="_blank"&gt;MISTI&lt;/a&gt; — and will continue in that role. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As MISTI faculty director, Lieberman has expanded global education opportunities for MIT students working in critical areas such as climate change, sustainability, AI, and global health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is a co-founder of the MIT Global Diversity Lab, where he and colleagues study the relationship between human diversity, development, and dignity in the United States and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His most recent book, “Until We Have Won Our Liberty: South Africa After Apartheid,” (Princeton University Press, 2022) has earned wide praise as a timely book on the lasting impact of democratic ideals. His sobering account of South Africa’s post-Apartheid transition from a minority rule to a democracy elucidates important achievements in government accountability, human rights, and improvements in quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Lieberman’s first charges at CIS will be inaugurating a new MIT China Policy Program, a project Samuels helped develop, that will be run by Fravel and Yasheng Huang, the Epoch Foundation Professor of International Management at MIT Sloan School of Management. The program, with seed funds from the associate provost’s office, will focus on the political, economic, and cultural dimensions of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is exactly the kind of program I’d like to see more of at CIS,” says Lieberman. “I want faculty to be aware that if they’re interested in doing research around a project in China, or Kenya, or Germany, CIS can help them learn about that place.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lieberman would like the center to foster collaborations across MIT on questions of vital importance, from climate change and the challenges of artificial intelligence to democratization, human rights, and human security. “I hope to bring people working on these problems into a broader campus conversation, so we can learn from each other about the different ways in which science and technology interact with the politics, economics, and cultures of different places around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a scholar whose own research interests lie at the intersection of politics and technology, Lieberman says, “It’s a joy to think about questions on a larger scale, and through cooperation with lots of colleagues, who will look at these issues in new and different ways.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dick Samuels has been a visionary leader for CIS. The center has thrived, expanded, and has never been more vibrant than it is today,” says Agustín Rayo, dean of the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences. "Evan Lieberman is a champion for international studies at MIT. He will be an excellent new director for the center.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Within 72 hours of the first Russian missiles striking Kyiv, Ukraine, in February 2022, Ian Miller SM ’19 boarded a flight for Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, he’d say he felt motivated by Kyiv's “tragic ocean of suffering" and Ukrainian President Zelensky’s pleas for help. But he arrived with little notion of what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he'd anticipated, his hotel in Rzeszów turned out to be a hub for aid workers and journalists. Miller was on his laptop, using the lobby Wi-Fi to work remotely as an MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI) project manager, when he overheard a reporter interviewing a Finnish man about his efforts to get bulletproof vests and helmets to the front lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miller soon found himself loading supplies onto trains that had brought huge numbers of refugees — mostly women, children, and the elderly — to the station in Rzeszów. The trains ran back at night, their empty seats filled with medical supplies, generators, and baby food, their lights dimmed to reduce the chances of attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2022, Miller and volunteers from a half-dozen countries planned and drove a convoy of trucks packed with tourniquets, bandages, and bulletproof vests across the border, arriving at the site of the Bucha massacre soon after the Russians retreated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miller peered into a mass grave. “They were still excavating it, and those weren't soldiers, you know?” he says. “I try to avoid looking at things like that too often, because it doesn't help us save lives to be horrified all the time.” He downplays any potential danger to himself, telling his family he’s safer where he is than in parts of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after his first trip across the border, Miller convinced his former MIT roommate, Evan Platt SM ’20, to come help. “Just for a week,” he told Platt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inspired by energy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miller and Platt met in 2008 in Washington, where Platt was interning at the White House and Miller was about to start his senior year at Georgetown University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miller majored in government, but his interest in energy policy and technology grew during the years after graduation he spent teaching science to primary and secondary school students in New York, where he’d grown up; in Boston; and in Kampala, Uganda. “Some of the most fun, inspiring, engaging lessons and modules I did with the kids were focused on energy,” he recalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While pursuing an MIT master of science in chemical engineering from 2016 to 2018, he started researching photovoltaics and wind power. He held leadership positions with the MIT Energy Conference and the MIT Energy Club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After joining MITEI, Miller worked on electric vehicles (EVs), EV charging patterns, and other applications. He became project manager and research specialist for the Sustainable Energy System Analysis Modeling Environment (SESAME), which models the levels of greenhouse gas emissions from multiple energy sectors in future scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miller and Platt reconnected and shared an apartment for three years. Platt studied systems design and management through a joint MIT School of Engineering and Sloan School of Management program, then stayed on to work for the MIT Technology Licensing Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Platt left MIT to pursue other interests in 2020. The next time the two would see each other would be in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s not easy living and working in an active combat zone,” Platt says. “There is nobody on Earth I would rather be navigating this environment with than Ian.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navigating the last mile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Rzeszów and Ukraine, Miller and U.S. Air Force veteran Mark Lindquist oversaw fulfillment for the new team. With the help of Google Translate, their phones lit up with encrypted texts to and from Polish customs agents and Ukrainian warehouse operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Platt and two Ukrainian team members took the lead on a needs analysis of what was most in demand at the front. Another team member led procurement. Their efforts crystallized in the creation of &lt;a href="https://zeroline.org/"&gt;Zero Line&lt;/a&gt;, a tax-exempt nonprofit that works closely with the Ukrainian government at the front line (a.k.a. “the zero line”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Platt on board, “we got more rigorous and quantitative in terms of lives-saved-per-dollar,” Miller says. A hundred dollars buys four tourniquets. A thousand dollars adds crude steel armor to a Jeep. Two thousand dollars provides a small observation drone or a satellite phone, equipment that locates Russian artillery and detects Russian attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Russian artillery shells are the No. 1 killer of Ukrainians, causing around 80 percent of casualties,” he says. “Tourniquets save people injured by Russian shells, vehicles help evacuate them, and communications equipment prevents deadly injuries from occurring in the first place.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miller’s skills in transportation and power system modeling, developed at MITEI under Principal Research Scientist Emre Gençer, helped the team transport more than 150 used vehicles — Nissan Pathfinders and vans for moving civilians away from the front, Ford pickups for transporting anti-missile defense systems — and hundreds of batteries, generators, drones, bulletproof vests, and helmets to the front through nightmarish logistical bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, supplies from the United States, Asia, and elsewhere in Europe move through Gdansk and Warsaw, then proceed via train or vehicle to warehouses in Lviv, around 70 kilometers east of the border. Next is the seven-hour trip to Kyiv or the 12-hour drive to Dnipro (the current southern edge of the safe “green zone”) and the final 200 kilometers to the front. Here, says Miller, drivers with training and protective gear, often members of the Ukrainian military, take vehicles and supplies to front-line end users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“From day one, we asked our Ukrainian members and partners for introductions, and we’re constantly looking for more,” Miller says. “When our vehicles reach the front lines, Evan’s team always does interviews about needs, and what's working, what's not. What's saving the most lives.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“From my early days with Ian, it’s clear he was always looking for ways to help people. Connections were really important to him,” says MITEI Director Robert C. Armstrong. “When war broke out, he found the call to answer human need irresistible. I think many of us think of doing that, but we get bogged down in the mechanics of everyday life. He just picked up and went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ian is just a terrific person and a great role model,” Armstrong says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerating peace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the time Miller arrived in late February through October 2022, he continued working remotely for MITEI. He now works full time as co-director of Zero Line. For the foreseeable future, Miller will remain in Ukraine and Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wants to see Ukrainians “follow in the happy, free, prospering footsteps of other ex-Soviet states, like the Baltics,” he says. He’d like to see the supply-chain innovations he and Platt achieved applied to humanitarian crises elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, Zero Line has raised more than $5 million in donations and delivered hundreds of tons of high-impact aid. “A key part of our approach has always been to support Ukrainians who excel in saving lives,” Miller says. To that end, the group works with Ukrainian software programmers and military units to create digital maps and processes to replace paper maps and operations “reminiscent of World War II,” Platt says. “Modernizing the intelligence infrastructure to facilitate better military operations is an important part of how a smaller military can beat a larger, more powerful military.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that energy underlies so many aspects of the war is never far from Miller’s mind. Russia cut off energy supplies to Europe, then targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure. On one hand, he understands that billions of people in developing countries such as India need and deserve affordable energy. On the other hand, he says, oil and gas purchases by those countries are directly funding Russia’s war machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Everyone wants cheap renewables and we’re getting there, but it’s taking time. Lowering the costs of renewables and energy storage and supporting nascent commercial fusion — that’s a very important focus of MITEI. In the long run, that’ll help us reach a more peaceful world, without a doubt.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work at MITEI and at Zero Line, Miller says, “truly could accelerate peace.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:creator>MIT Center for International Studies</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today marks the 20th anniversary of the United States-led invasion of Iraq. Code-named &lt;/em&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Operation Iraqi Freedom&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;em&gt; by the George W. Bush administration, the goal was to eliminate weapons of mass destruction, topple Saddam Hussein, and remake Iraq into a democracy. Two decades later, U.S. troops are still on Iraqi soil and that nation is ravaged by challenges, including a threat of civil war last August. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To mark the anniversary, &lt;a href="https://cis.mit.edu/news-media/news-releases/diplomat-and-policymaker-steven-simon-joins-cis-its-2021-robert-e-wilhelm"&gt;Steven Simon&lt;/a&gt;, the Robert E Wilhelm Fellow at the MIT Center for International Studies;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/political-science/people/faculty-directory/peter-krause.html"&gt;Peter Krause&lt;/a&gt; PhD ’11, an MIT Security Studies Program research affiliate and an associate professor of political science at Boston College; and &lt;a href="https://polisci.mit.edu/people/marsin-alshamary" target="_blank"&gt;Marsin Alshamary&lt;/a&gt; PhD ’20, an assistant professor at Boston College discuss the history behind the war, lessons learned on state-building, and Iraq’s current political outlook. They, along with &lt;a href="https://polisci.mit.edu/people/roger-petersen"&gt;Roger Petersen&lt;/a&gt;, the Arthur and Ruth Sloan Professor of Political Science, will be speaking at a virtual MIT Starr Forum, &lt;a href="https://calendar.mit.edu/event/mit_starr_forum_the_iraq_invasion_twenty_years_later#.ZAZAjC1h30o"&gt;The Iraq Invasion: Twenty Years Later&lt;/a&gt;, on March 24. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What lessons have political scientists learned from the Iraqi insurgency and the U.S. counterinsurgency campaign?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peter Krause: &lt;/strong&gt;One of the first lessons political scientists learned is that that their analysis and predictions can be strikingly accurate, even when their opinions are contrary to those of policymakers and the general public. Although the George W. Bush administration planned and initiated the invasion and a majority of Americans supported it,&amp;nbsp;a &lt;a href="https://ciaotest.cc.columbia.edu/journals/intpol/v52i1/f_0033526_27310.pdf" title="https://ciaotest.cc.columbia.edu/journals/intpol/v52i1/f_0033526_27310.pdf"&gt;majority of political scientists did not&lt;/a&gt;. A number of prominent political scientists, including four from MIT, took out&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://nationalinterest.org/feature/what-difference-16-years-doesnt-make-iraq-we-asked-experts-51677" title="https://nationalinterest.org/feature/what-difference-16-years-doesnt-make-iraq-we-asked-experts-51677"&gt;a full page ad in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in September 2002, arguing that the war “[was] not in America’s national interest,” and that such a conflict would “spread instability in the Middle East,” “[increase] anti-Americanism,” “jeopardize the campaign against Al-Qaeda” by diverting resources and attention, and that the U.S. had no plausible exit strategy from Iraq. All of these fears were realized in the subsequent conflict. Although political scientists were unable to do much to impact the decision to go to war, they should take heart that unlike the collapse of the Soviet Union or the Great Recession of 2007-2008, this was a crisis that most saw coming and actively tried to prevent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second lesson is that although the U.S. military remains the strongest in the world and has proven its ability to topple regimes, the desire and ability of U.S. policymakers and military leaders to effectively predict and plan for “the day after” a regime falls is lacking. Iraq is unfortunately one of many interventions in the broader Middle East that led to long, seemingly unforeseen insurgencies and individuals leading the new governments that were not who the U.S. predicted or desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third lesson is that although the U.S. government and military may want to learn the first two lessons and subsequently avoid counterinsurgency for the foreseeable future, that is easier said than done. The U.S. can and should be more selective in its interventions, but civil war is by far the most common form of conflict in the modern era. The strength of the U.S. military in any stand-up fight means that resistance to American intervention is likely to take the form of insurgency in the future— especially since adversaries know it is a form of warfare that the American military and public prefer to avoid. In his forthcoming book that explores this topic, Roger Petersen reminds us that&amp;nbsp;“The U.S. cannot simply wish away insurgencies. They are going to occur. The question is what the U.S. and other great powers might do about them.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What are the major opportunities and challenges facing the Iraqi government?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steven Simon&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;The effects of the wars between Iraq and the United States are still playing out. It might be 20 years after G.W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq, but the conflict began in the months of 1991. In the interval, Iraq was the target of a massive air campaign and 12 years of sweeping economic sanctions that killed, impoverished, sickened, and stunted a large part of Iraq’s noncombatant population. This grim period was punctuated by periodic airstrikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combat operations did not really end until ISIS was defeated in 2016. Beginning with Jerry Bremmer’s arrival in Baghdad in 2003, the U.S. dismantled the Iraqi military, undermined Iraq’s residual administrative capacity through de-Baathification, and implanted a consociational political order that normalized corruption and impeded effective governance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Iraq therefore faces serious challenges. During the past year, Iraqi politics were shaken by an attempt to overturn the apportionment system that has regulated Iraq’s government since shortly after the invasion. The ensuing crisis ended in a violent confrontation and the defeat of the party seeking to overturn the existing system and replace it with a majority government. The irony was that the faction pressing for this transformation was itself the embodiment of the old way of doing business and trusted by no other political faction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the positive side, the gunfire and rocket launches that ended the confrontation ended as quickly as it began and did not devolve into an insurgency or civil war. The system was resilient enough to emerge intact from a severe stress test. On the negative side, the system is scarcely appropriate to Iraq’s existing economic difficulties and ability to deliver the range of services on which Iraqi society depends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iraq is currently saddled with a hybrid military structure consisting of regular army units and a congeries of mostly Shi’a militias with ties of various intensities to Iran. These irregular units emerged from the ISIS invasion of 2014 and report to the prime minister. The split in the chain of command and divided loyalties of some of these militias is a problem that Iraqis have learned to live with, but could prove more than just awkward if, for example, the U.S. and Iran go to war. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the U.S. military presence of about 2,500 troops carrying out an advisory and training program and Iran’s support for well-armed militias, Iraq is also burdened by Turkish and Iranian military intervention in Iraqi Kurdistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most daunting challenge facing Iraq is climate change. Iraq is already being pummeled by global heating. The southern marshes, an area of habitation and resource extraction, are drying up. Riparian waters are diminishing. The government in Baghdad lacks the capacity to develop and enforce mitigating measures and help is unlikely to come from outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opportunities for Iraq reside in its young population. The question is whether the country’s political economy can secure this cohort an education and job opportunities. In 2019, Iraqi youth erupted in protest against the political system that has failed to provide basic necessities and avenues of advancement. The protests were harshly suppressed by the armed wings of many parties across the spectrum of Iraqi political actors; the system, after all, is essential, among other things, to their ability to maintain patronage networks. Protests have not since broken out but could recur at virtually any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important opportunity lies in renewed diplomatic and economic ties to the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. Although these wealthy countries have thus far been hesitant to invest in Iraq, emerging links are the necessary precursor to this key component of economic development.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What was the context for the August 2022 protests in Iraq? Why did they turn violent?&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marsin Alshamary&lt;/strong&gt;: In August 2022, Iraq was once more on the verge of civil war. This time, the conflict was not sectarian as it had been in the 2006-08 war, when Shia and Sunni armed groups fought one another and rearranged the map of Baghdad along religious lines. Rather, this near-civil war would have taken place between different factions belonging to Iraq’s largest and most powerful ethno-religious group, the Shia. In many ways, the transition from inter-group violence to intra-group violence reflected the consolidation of Iraq’s informal power-sharing system of governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This near-civil war revolved around a familiar cast of characters. First, there is Muqtada Al-Sadr, notorious amongst American audiences for leading the anti-American insurgency in 2004. Sadr has — like many Iraqi politicians — restyled himself from a militia leader to a politician. His populist messaging resonates with poorer Iraqis and resulted in victories at the ballot box. In the 2018 election, Sadr joined forces with the Iraqi Communist Party and won 54 of the 329 parliamentary seats. In the 2021 early elections, which were held to assuage a wave of anti-government protests, Sadr won 73 seats. In this latest election, the Sadrists were once again the biggest winners, but this time with significantly more seats than the runners-up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not surprising, then, that Sadr saw himself as kingmaker and chose to disrupt the traditional consensus model that Iraq’s politicians had clung to since 2005. He allied himself with the Sunni Taqadum Party and the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) in an attempt to form a government of majority and opposition, rather than consensus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadr’s goal was to force his Shia rivals, the Coordination Framework, into the role of opposition. The Coordination Framework is a group of Shia political parties including former Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki’s State of Law, former wartime Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi’s Alliance of Nation State Forces (in partnership with Ammar Al-Hakim, formerly of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq), the Fateh Alliance (consisting of several prominent paramilitary groups from the Popular Mobilization Forces), and smaller parties including current Prime Minister Mohammed Al-Sudani’s Furatain Party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the American perspective, the Coordination Framework includes some friendly faces (Haider Al-Abadi and Ammar Al-Hakim) and some whose ties to Iran are worrying (Hadi Al-Ameri and Qais Al-Khazali). Nevertheless, both Iran and the United States largely kept out of the government formation process. At the time, media and analysts largely told a one-dimensional tale of Muqtada Al-Sadr as a reformist and the Coordination Framework as Iranian stooges. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sadrists and the Coordination Framework clashed for months, drawing the government formation process for over a year while everyday Iraqis continued to suffer under poor services, security incursions from Turkey and Iran, and the excruciating effects of climate change. The Coordination Framework deployed many tactics to prevent Sadr from forming a majority government, including resorting to the Federal Supreme Court and preventing parliamentary quorums required to elect a president. By June, Sadr grew frustrated at the Coordination Framework and his own allies — Taqadum and the KDP — for their half-hearted investment in a majority government. He ordered his 73 MPs to resign and for his followers to take to the International Zone, a fortified area in central Baghdad that houses government buildings, the U.N. compound, and various foreign missions, including the American Embassy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a few weeks, the protests were relatively peaceful but hugely destabilizing for daily affairs. New parliamentarians were sworn in and the numbers for the Coordination Framework swelled. They set about forming a government without Sadr while he called on the Iraqi people to join his protestors to demand a change in government type. Everyday Iraqis — who had in 2019 come out in droves to protest the government — largely stayed out of it, fearing the Sadrists’ known mercurial nature. In 2019, the Sadrists vacillated between supporting the popular protest movement and between turning against it violently. Iraqis have little faith in their political leaders, including Sadr, who often tries to style himself as a man of the people.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peace did not hold. In late August, Sadr announced his withdrawal from politics and suggested that he would not be responsible for the behavior of his followers. The protests turned violent as the Sadrists and members of the Iraqi Security Forces and Popular Mobilization Forces fought each other in clashes that extended beyond Baghdad. During that restless night, residents of Baghdad were reminded of the civil war. For many observers, it looked as though Iraq was falling into a Shia-Shia civil war. The next day, presumably under pressure from elite Shia clerics and due to a military defeat in the International Zone, Sadr apologized to the Iraqi people and called for his followers to halt the violence. They immediately demobilized.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tensions with the Sadrists have not dissipated and will lurk in the background of Prime Minister Sudani’s premiership. The context of this violence is different from instances of violence in the past. It is not directed at an occupying force or an ethno-religious enemy. Rather, it is a manifestation of competition among the Shia.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Assessing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, after a year of war </title>

  <description><![CDATA[MIT event examines effects of the war on domestic politics and daily life in both Ukraine and Russia.]]></description>
  <pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2023 13:40:00 -0500</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2023/assessing-russias-invasion-ukraine-after-one-year-0306</guid>
        <dc:creator>Peter Dizikes | MIT News Office</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has been withstanding Russia’s invasion for slightly more than a year. One element of this resistance has been the military aid many allies have provided Ukraine. But surely the most important factor, ever since Russia attacked in February 2022, has been the strong sense of solidarity Ukranians have displayed in their attempt to keep their country free and democratic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was one takeaway from a recent public discussion at MIT, “Ukraine and Russia One Year On: The Domestic Impact of the War.” The event, held online, was the latest iteration of the Starr Forum, MIT’s prominent event series on foreign policy and international relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is most important when we look at the internal dynamics now in Ukraine,” said panelist Olga Onuch, a senior lecturer and associate professor in politics at the University of Manchester in the U.K. “Ukrainians not only have shown resilience and resistance, but they have doubled down on [these] things, that are likely to be the most important element of their fight for victory, this incredible sense of a collective action to protect the values and rights that are dear to them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anything, the ongoing war has heightened a previously existing trend toward support for democracy among Ukrainians, which had already been on the rise. As Onuch pointed out, polling shows that from 2019 through February 2022, backing for democracy among Ukrainians rose from around 40 percent to nearly 60 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Increasingly, ordinary citizens have seen it their duty to engage in elections, to volunteer in societal organzations, and to engage in protest,” Onuch said. “This is something that has been building over time. … This is not simply a wartime rally.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onuch is author of “The Zelensky Effect,” a recent book about people who develop a civic-minded sense of duty to their countries, rather than an ethno-national perspective. She is also an affiliate of the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Starr Forum is organized by MIT’s Center for International Studies (CIS). This event was co-sponsored by MIT’s Security Studies Program (SSP) and the MIT-Eurasia program, in addition to CIS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event’s moderators were Elizabeth Wood, a professor of history at MIT, author of the 2016 book “Roots of Russia’s War in Ukraine,” and co-director of the MISTI MIT-Eurasia Program; and Carol Saivetz, a senior advisor in SSP and a longstanding expert on Soviet and Russian foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event also featured remarks from Yevgenia Albats, a Russian investigative journalist and political scientist who edits &lt;em&gt;The New Times&lt;/em&gt; magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I feel ashamed, sorry, for what my country, Russia, which I am a citizen of, has done to Ukraine, in Ukraine and to its people,” Albats said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Describing the domestic situation in Russia, Albats detailed her own travails; she has left Russia under threat of serving jail time and is living abroad. Like other journalists, she faced ongoing surveillance as Russia continues to roll back freedom of speech. Friends of hers currently are serving prison sentences, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s how you live day after day,” Albats said. “And you know that all your communications are taped. [You] never have any guests. You never know who comes to your house. When you leave your house and get in your car, you are followed all around.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Albats, who during her career has been a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University and a senior fellow at Harvard's Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies, suggested that prospects for future mass action were limited in Russia, but she held out some hope for a change of leadership in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are not going to be any popular uprisings,” Albats said. “There’s going to be elite politics, and sooner or later, there will be some sort of a coup d’etat. Don’t expect that this will bring democratic politics into power.” Such a change might, however, “break the spell” that Russian president Vladimir Putin has over the country, she added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onuch, for her part, expressed disappointment that Russians have not conducted more visible antiwar protests, either within the country or among the immigrant communities in foreign cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why haven’t we seen large actions, or [even] very small actions?” she asked. In foreign capitals, she added, “We have not actually seen large Russian-led antiwar demonstrations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the future course of the war, Onuch suggested that the rise in Ukrainian national solidarity in support of independence and democracy could make it more difficult for any leader of the country to deliver a settlement ending the war, if it did not meet the expectations of the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is both the secret weapon that Zelensky has in his tool kit, but it’s also potentially an achilles heel for any politician that oversteps,” Onuch said. “This is where the potential problems for political elite[s] arise. They cannot negotiate that which they cannot deliver. Zelensky is not the one who is building the nation, he is not the one that is making the democratic Ukrainian nation. In fact, the Democratic Ukrainian nation is the one that made him who he is today, and without their support he simply will not be able to deliver on any negotiations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Russia’s part, she added, “We all know Russia strategically, militarily, has lost the war it set out to embark on in February [2022]. … It has lost that version of the war, it has now changed tactics, we have seen more missiles, aerial bombings, and we expect that to continue.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that Russia has not swiftly overwhelmed Ukraine, while Ukrainians have dug in so strongly, indeed indicates that the war may continue for an extended period of time, she added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I just don’t see this ending any time soon,” Onuch said.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Jupneet Singh: Finding purpose through service</title>

  <description><![CDATA[“I feel a great connection to my community, and I always want to find a way to give back,” says the Rhodes Scholar and Air Force ROTC wing commander.]]></description>
  <pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2023 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2023/jupneet-singh-finding-purpose-through-service-0224</guid>
        <dc:creator>Laura Rosado | MIT News correspondent</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As a first-year U.S. Air Force cadet in the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC), Jupneet Singh never imagined she would rise to the rank of wing commander by the end of her MIT career. She approached her first year as a trial period without many expectations, but the close-knit community and inspiring leadership compelled her to continue in the program. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As commander, Singh is the highest-ranked cadet in Detachment 365, which includes students from MIT, Harvard University, Wellesley College, and Tufts University. The detachment was recently named best large detachment in the nation by Air Force ROTC. She oversees everything that happens and is the direct contact between the officer and cadet divisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her decision to enroll in ROTC “really came down to believing in the values that the U.S. stands for, specifically freedom of religion,” says Singh, who is Sikh. “My parents were in India in 1984 during the Sikh Massacre, and hearing them talk about it is obviously very painful. Here in the U.S. that’s something that, in principle, doesn’t happen, and that makes me proud to serve.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Singh was growing up in Southern California, her family instilled in her the value of service to one’s community and often volunteered at Sikh Gurdwara community kitchens and religious retreats. Her mother would often mention how lucky they were to be able to give back, right in their backyard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I felt a lot of support from my community when I was growing up, and I want to make sure that other kids feel that same support and can also succeed and flourish,” says Singh, who has founded two organizations that do just that. “I feel a great connection to my community, and I always want to find a way to give back.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singh is a senior majoring in chemistry with a minor in history. In her research at MIT she has examined the biochemistry of human innate immunity and microbial pathogenesis through research on natural products at the &lt;a href="http://web.mit.edu/nolanlab/Nolan_Lab_Website/Home.html" target="_blank"&gt;Nolan Lab&lt;/a&gt;, and investigated fatty liver disease with computational biology at the &lt;a href="https://shaleklab.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Shalek Lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following graduation, she will pursue a master’s degree focused on policy at Oxford University as a &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/three-mit-named-2023-rhodes-scholars-1112" target="_blank"&gt;Rhodes Scholar&lt;/a&gt; — the first-ever scholar from the Air Force ROTC program. Then, she’ll commission as a second lieutenant in the Air Force and attend medical school with the goal of becoming a trauma surgeon. Looking ahead in her career, Singh wants to blend health and policy and continue to support grassroots efforts in addition to higher-level policy changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Advocating for health and health care is the foundation for closing inequities in other aspects of life,” says Singh. “If someone isn’t able to access proper health care when they need it, then they can’t focus on education, income, or anything else. It’s also really important to me that whatever policy or programs I support are being looked at from a local, grassroots level. If a lot of changes are enacted but you don’t refer to the communities who are actually affected by them, they cannot be as effective.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making a lasting impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In high school, Singh started the program Tennis for Tots. A longtime tennis player herself, she wanted to increase access to the sport that generally has a high cost to entry. By partnering with her high school’s tennis team, Tennis for Tots was able to provide rackets, balls, and a weekly clinic free of charge for underserved youth across multiple school districts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, Singh found herself spending an unplanned year at home, where she saw an opportunity to start another program that built upon the mission of Tennis for Tots. She worked with the Ventura County Family Justice Center to start Pathways to Promise, a program that provides support to children affected by domestic violence to help them achieve their goals. Pathways offers educational and vocational support through field trips, keynote speakers, and college-bound workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“At big public schools, there may not be the one-on-one attention needed to give these kids motivation or expand their horizons,” says Singh. “This program was something that I was passionate about because while Tennis for Tots was improving the physical wellbeing of kids, Pathways was mental wellbeing, educational wellbeing, and giving social support. The other part that is important is the continuous nature of it. Every month we have this programming instead of just seeing them once a year.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singh followed up her work with Pathways to Promise by collaborating on and publishing a research paper as first author, examining domestic violence trends in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though she doesn’t plan to return to her hometown in the near future, both Tennis for Tots and Pathways to Promise continue to expand and provide much needed resources to her community, and she returns periodically to stay involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding moments to be creative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the next few years of Singh’s life seem highly prescribed, she’s keeping an open mind to new opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I like having a clear path, but within the next few years I’m going to keep creating spaces to take initiative,” says Singh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://mitmocktrial.weebly.com/" target="_blank"&gt;MIT Mock Trial team&lt;/a&gt; has kept her creative juices flowing at MIT, and another way Singh flexes her creative muscles is by playing the harmonium, an Indian instrument similar to an organ. Her grandmother was a harmonium teacher, and Singh has been playing and performing in Sikh temples since she was 2 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singh is also looking forward to her service in the Air Force and the opportunities she’ll have as a physician-leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Being a doctor in the Air Force is so different from being a doctor in the civilian world, in terms of the people you serve and the opportunities you get to implement initiatives and programs so early in your career,” says Singh. “My dream would be to be the Surgeon General. The Air Force fits really well into that path of being able to serve as a doctor and also be a leader.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Improving the speed and safety of airport security screening</title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2023/improving-airport-security-screening-0216</link>
  <description><![CDATA[Lincoln Laboratory seeks ways to build non-contact screening methods that can detect concealed explosives at airports.]]></description>
  <pubDate>Thu, 16 Feb 2023 16:20:00 -0500</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2023/improving-airport-security-screening-0216</guid>
        <dc:creator>Anne McGovern | MIT Lincoln Laboratory</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For decades, airports around the nation have employed sensitive canine noses to detect concealed explosives. While this four-legged fleet has been effective and efficient, researchers have yet to build a mechanical method that can mimic their abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sasha Wrobel and Ta-Hsuan Ong are leading a team of researchers from MIT Lincoln Laboratory’s Biological and Chemical Technologies Group to try to find a way. The team’s research builds on the laboratory’s ongoing work to create and use a mass spectrometer to help train bomb-sniffing dogs, a project that is supported by the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;amp;T) &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/detection-canine"&gt;Detection Canine Program&lt;/a&gt;. Wrobel and Ong are using the spectrometer to measure explosive vapors in order to understand the requirements for creating an operational explosive detection system. This system would work in tandem with the canine fleet to improve current airport security systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DHS S&amp;amp;T is also sponsoring this work through the &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/secondary-screening#:~:text=The%20Secondary%20Screening%20Technology%20Development%20Program%20focuses%20on,including%3A%20Transportation%20Security%20Administration%20Customs%20and%20Border%20Protection"&gt;Next-Generation Explosives Trace Detection&lt;/a&gt; (NextGen ETD) program, which was launched to stay ahead of the evolving landscape of explosive development from adversaries both within and outside of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vapor footprints&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airports have two layers of carry-on baggage screening. One is when passengers place their belongings on a conveyor belt that passes through an X-ray machine. Another is when a bag gets pushed to the side and a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agent opens the bag to check the contents and uses a swab on the bag to search for explosive residues. In some cases, canines also play a role in security screening as a complement to swabbing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the swabs detect explosive residues through contact and chemical analysis, canines detect them by sniffing for vapor signatures. The air is full of particles and gases, such as water, acetone from plants and trees, and even ethanol from hand sanitizer. Explosives also leave their mark in the air. Non-contact detection that uses these vapor signatures has the potential to be much quicker than swabs. Wrobel, Ong, and the team are searching to understand the technology specifications needed to do this by collecting signature data with the spectrometer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The mass spectrometer samples the air around an item and then ionizes the vapors given off by the sample," Wrobel says. "Depending on how these chemicals ionize, we can identify the chemical vapors by analyzing the mass, charge, and fragmentation patterns reported in mass spectra data."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, the research team has conducted three phases of tests. The tests were conducted at the University of Rhode Island’s &lt;a href="http://energetics.chm.uri.edu/"&gt;explosives test range&lt;/a&gt;, which is part of Northeastern University’s Awareness and Localization of Explosives-Related Threats (ALERT) program, a &lt;a href="https://alert.northeastern.edu/"&gt;multi-university DHS Center of Excellence&lt;/a&gt;. At the range, the team used the mass spectrometer to measure the air around nearly 100 different explosive samples concealed in various packaging configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They collected several thousand measurements to understand how the different sample configurations influence the vapor signatures of concealed explosives. The team also plans to use these data to evaluate how data processing algorithms impact instrument and detection performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end goal is to use the data that the team collected to build a list of requirements for developing an operational instrument. The DHS can use this list to decide how to proceed in contacting industry partners to develop the necessary technology and in coordinating their efforts with similar ones in Europe, led by the European Civil Aviation Conference. While there is much more work to do before the team can fully understand what it might take to build a non-contact detection system, they are hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Developing and improving methods for explosives detection would streamline passenger experience and safety during airport security screening, while also supporting technology to remain resilient against new and evolving security threats," Wrobel says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detecting from all angles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vapor detection research is just one example of the laboratory’s involvement in the NextGen ETD program. The Biological and Chemical Technologies Group is also involved in a project to create more effective swabs for security checkpoints and is exploring whether infrared lasers could be used to detect explosive particles on luggage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The core technology is called longwave infrared imaging," says Bill Barney, who leads the infrared laser program. "It uses a laser that is scanned over a surface, and the scattered laser light has a spectrum to it. Some of the wavelengths of light in that spectrum are absorbed by explosives, which means the spectrum contains a fingerprint of the explosive that we can detect."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the infrared method is complicated by clutter and false alarms. Some materials absorb the light in a similar way to explosives, so there is a need to be able to differentiate them. Barney and his team have turned to machine learning to solve this problem, which is better at unraveling complex data and making connections between data points that humans may not see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Last year, we were very successful in detecting low levels of explosives on our test samples, which is promising," says Barney. "But there's a lot of engineering and science left to do before you would be able to get this kind of system working in an airport."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rod Kunz, who is an associate leader of the Biological and Chemical Technologies Group, says that Lincoln Laboratory’s involvement in the NextGen ETD program fills an important niche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The main performers on this program are industry — companies that sell things to the TSA to use in airports," Kunz says. "Our role is to try to understand if other technologies would work for airport needs, if there are other advanced concepts that should be sent to industry for them to respond to, or if there are directions that industry just doesn't think are worth pursuing that the laboratory could be trying instead. We are trying to plug in the gaps that industry and the normal procurement processes are unable to do."&lt;/p&gt;

  <description><![CDATA[An expert panel examines the implications of energy use and energy policy during Russia’s invasion.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is having a global impact on many areas of the world today, affecting the balance of power among states and creating a contest between democratic and authoritarian alliances. It is also having a major impact on the global energy supply. European states have scrambled to reorient their consumption away from Russian natural gas, while Russia has used its energy assets as political leverage while finding new economic partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, there is also a battle over energy surrounding the invasion, as a panel of experts analyzed at a public MIT event on Friday. The online discussion, “Energy As a Weapon of War,” was the latest Starr Forum, MIT’s prominent event series on foreign policy and international relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forum’s two featured speakers both discussed energy issues as well as the larger course of the war. Margarita Balmaceda, a professor of diplomacy and international relations at Seton Hall University and an associate of the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute, listed three key aspects of the energy issue implicated in the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first place, she noted, European reliance on Russian natural gas is a long-term issue that also existed with the Russian occupation of Crimea in 2014, but is only now being managed differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="descnormal"&gt;“If we look at the case of Germany … you can see that the temptation of this reliance in particular on Russian natural gas was not simply something that you could ascribe to one or two corrupt politicians,” said Balmaceda, author of the book “Russian Energy Chains: The Remaking of&amp;nbsp;Technopolitics from Siberia to Ukraine to the European Union.” Instead, she said, “it’s something that went to all levels of economic life,” including industrial consumers of natural gas, regional governments, and other stakeholders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="descnormal"&gt;Secondly, Balmaceda observed, many core manufacturing industries, especially in Germany, have been particularly dependent on Russian energy, making the need for alternatives something that has direct effects in key production sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="descnormal"&gt;“In my view, the real story, and the story we have to pay much more attention to, has to do with … industrial users of natural gas,” Balmaceda said. In fact, she noted, gas consumption is a major part of the production cycle in Europe’s chemical, cement, steel, and paper industries, supporting about 8 million jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="descnormal"&gt;Finally, Balmaceda observed, European boycotts of Russian energy may have temporarily stymied Russia, but the regime has subsequently found new markets in China, India, and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="descnormal"&gt;“It’s very important to understand that this story does not end in the European Union and North America, and if we don’t deal with the real energy concerns of global South countries, we will not get very far in trying to reduce Russia’s energy power moving forward,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="descnormal"&gt;Constanze Stelzenmüller, director and Fritz Stern Chair of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution, offered some political context as well as her own perspective on paths forward in the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="descnormal"&gt;While policymakers in Europe frequently praise the response of the Biden administration in the U.S., in support of Ukraine, “It’s also remarkable how steadfast the European response has been,” Stelzenmüller said. She added, “It’s something I was very worried about.” She also praised the German government for “decoupling German dependence from Russian gas and oil imports in ways I honestly would not have thought possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="descnormal"&gt;While the alliance supporting Ukraine has been valuable, Stelzenmüller said, she believes the U.S. and Europe need to give Ukraine even more backing in terms of weaponry in particular. “It is unclear, at this point still, whether Ukraine will have the means to retain full control over its territory.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="descnormal"&gt;Meanwhile, Russia’s relationship with China, she added, is profoundly consequential for the long-term trajectory of the war. So far, China has been nominally pledging broad support of Russia while publicly de-escalating the nuclear rhetoric arising from the war. However, Stelzenmüller added, if China decides to “actively support” Russia militarily, “That would be, I think, the worst game-changer of all, and one that … would be the single greatest challenge that I can envision to our ability to help Ukraine win, and to maintain our own security in Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Starr Forum is organized by MIT’s Center for International Studies (CIS). Friday’s event was co-sponsored by MIT’s Security Studies Program and the MIT-Eurasia program, in addition to CIS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event’s moderators were Elizabeth Wood, a professor of history at MIT, author of the 2016 book “Roots of Russia’s War in Ukraine,” and co-director of the MISTI MIT-Eurasia Program; and Carol Saivetz, a senior advisor in MIT’s Security Studies Program and expert on Soviet and Russian foreign policy. Wood and Saivetz have helped host a series of Starr Forum events over the last year scrutinizing several aspects of Russia’s invasion and Ukraine’s defense.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the role of energy in the war “is obviously of critical importance today,” Wood said in her opening remarks. That includes, she noted, “How energy is being used by Russia as a tool of aggression, how Ukraine is suffering from attacks upon its critical infrastructure, and how the alliance of European [states] and the U.S. is responding.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to audience questions, the scholars outlined multiple scenarios in which the war could end, either on more favorable terms for Ukraine or in ways that strengthen Russia. One audience member also queried about the extent to which the current war could also be thought of as a “carbon war, or climate war,” in which a move toward clean energy also lessens global dependence on large gas and oil suppliers, such as Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, Balmaceda noted that the ongoing infrastructure development in Ukraine might, in theory, leave it with no choice but to modernize its energy infrastructure (though its own orientation toward fossil fuels represents just a small portion of global demand). Stelzenmüller added that “Ukraine will need much more than just to reorient its energy [demand]. … It will have to change its role in the global economy,” given its own industrial reliance on coal and other fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Balmaceda added, “Regardless of whether Russia wins this conflict or loses, the rottenness within Russia is deep enough to be bad news for all of us for a long time.” For her part, Stelzenmüller underscored again how vital increased alliance support would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We should show that we are willing and able to defend not just a country that has been attacked by a great power, but willing to defend ourselves,” Stelzenmüller said. Otherwise, she added, “If we didn’t do that, we would have set for all the world to see a precedent of giving in to blackmail, including nuclear blackmail, and allowing this to happen without us being willing to see the defense of Ukraine through to the end.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <description><![CDATA[MIT Energy Initiative Annual Research Conference highlights both opportunities and obstacles in the race to a net-zero future.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;“The past six years have been the warmest on the planet, and our track record on climate change mitigation is drastically short of what it needs to be,” said Robert C. Armstrong, MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI) director and the Chevron Professor of Chemical Engineering, introducing MITEI’s 15th Annual Research Conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the symposium, participants from academia, industry, and finance acknowledged the deepening difficulties of decarbonizing a world rocked by geopolitical conflicts and suffering from supply chain disruptions, energy insecurity, inflation, and a persistent pandemic. In spite of this grim backdrop, the conference offered evidence of significant progress in the energy transition. Researchers provided glimpses of a low-carbon future, presenting advances in such areas as long-duration energy storage, carbon capture, and renewable technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his keynote remarks, Ernest J. Moniz, the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Physics and Engineering Systems Emeritus, founding director of MITEI, and former U.S. secretary of energy, highlighted “four areas that have materially changed in the last year” that could shake up, and possibly accelerate, efforts to address climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extreme weather seems to be propelling the public and policy makers of both U.S. parties toward “convergence … at least in recognition of the challenge,” Moniz said. He perceives a growing consensus that climate goals will require — in diminishing order of certainty — firm (always-on) power to complement renewable energy sources, a fuel (such as hydrogen) flowing alongside electricity, and removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with its “weaponization of natural gas” and global energy impacts, underscores the idea that climate, energy security, and geopolitics “are now more or less recognized widely as one conversation.” Moniz pointed as well to new U.S. laws on climate change and infrastructure that will amplify the role of science and technology and “address the drive to technological dominance by China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid transformation of energy systems will require a comprehensive industrial policy, Moniz said. Government and industry must select and rapidly develop low-carbon fuels, firm power sources (possibly including nuclear power), CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; removal systems, and long-duration energy storage technologies. “We will need to make progress on all fronts literally in this decade to come close to our goals for climate change mitigation,” he concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global cooperation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over two days, conference participants delved into many of the issues Moniz raised. In one of the first panels, scholars pondered whether the international community could forge a coordinated climate change response. The United States’ rift with China, especially over technology trade policies, loomed large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hatred of China is a bipartisan hobby and passion, but a blanket approach isn’t right, even for the sake of national security,” said Yasheng Huang, the Epoch Foundation Professor of Global Economics and Management at the MIT Sloan School of Management. “Although the United States and China working together would have huge effects for both countries, it is politically unpalatable in the short term,” said F. Taylor Fravel, the Arthur and Ruth Sloan Professor of Political Science and director of the MIT Security Studies Program. John E. Parsons, deputy director for research at the MIT Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, suggested that the United States should use this moment “to get our own act together … and start doing things,” such as building nuclear power plants in a cost-effective way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debating carbon removal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several panels took up the matter of carbon emissions and the most promising technologies for contending with them. &lt;a href="https://energy.mit.edu/arc/?utm_source=MIT+Energy+Initiative&amp;amp;utm_campaign=f704de314b-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2022_09_08_12_58_COPY_01&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_eb3c6d9c51-f704de314b-76109097&amp;amp;mc_cid=f704de314b&amp;amp;mc_eid=ed735c5a35#harvey"&gt;Charles Harvey&lt;/a&gt;, MIT professor of civil and environmental engineering, and &lt;a href="https://energy.mit.edu/arc/?utm_source=MIT+Energy+Initiative&amp;amp;utm_campaign=f704de314b-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2022_09_08_12_58_COPY_01&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_eb3c6d9c51-f704de314b-76109097&amp;amp;mc_cid=f704de314b&amp;amp;mc_eid=ed735c5a35#herzog"&gt;Howard Herzog&lt;/a&gt;, a senior research engineer at MITEI, set the stage early, debating whether capturing carbon was essential to reaching net-zero targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I have no trouble getting to net zero without carbon capture and storage,” said David Keith, the Gordon McKay Professor of Applied Physics at Harvard University, in a subsequent roundtable. Carbon capture seems more risky to Keith than solar geoengineering, which involves injecting sulfur into the stratosphere to offset CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and its heat-trapping impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are new ways of moving carbon from where it’s a problem to where it’s safer. Kripa K. Varanasi, MIT professor of mechanical engineering, described a process for modulating the pH of ocean water to remove CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Timothy Krysiek, managing director for Equinor Ventures, talked about construction of a 900-kilometer pipeline transporting CO&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;from northern Germany to a large-scale storage site located in Norwegian waters 3,000 meters below the seabed. “We can use these offshore Norwegian assets as a giant carbon sink for Europe,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A startup showcase featured additional approaches to the carbon challenge. Mantel, which received MITEI Seed Fund money, is developing molten salt material to capture carbon for long-term storage or for use in generating electricity. Verdox has come up with an electrochemical process for capturing dilute CO&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;from the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while much of the global warming discussion focuses on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, other greenhouse gases are menacing. Another panel discussed measuring and mitigating these pollutants. “Methane has 82 times more warming power than CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the point of emission,” said Desirée L. Plata, MIT associate professor of civil and environmental engineering. “Cutting methane is the strongest lever we have to slow climate change in the next 25 years — really the only lever.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven Hamburg, chief scientist and senior vice president of the Environmental Defense Fund, cautioned that emission of hydrogen molecules into the atmosphere can cause increases in other greenhouse gases such as methane, ozone, and water vapor. As researchers and industry turn to hydrogen as a fuel or as a feedstock for commercial processes, “we will need to minimize leakage … or risk increasing warming,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supply chains, markets, and new energy ventures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In panels on energy storage and the clean energy supply chain, there were interesting discussions of challenges ahead. High-density energy materials such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, and vanadium for grid-scale energy storage, electric vehicles (EVs), and other clean energy technologies, can be difficult to source. “These often come from water-stressed regions, and we need to be super thoughtful about environmental stresses,” said Elsa Olivetti, the Esther and Harold E. Edgerton Associate Professor in Materials Science and Engineering. She also noted that in light of the explosive growth in demand for metals such as lithium, recycling EVs won’t be of much help. “The amount of material coming back from end-of-life batteries is minor,” she said, until EVs are much further along in their adoption cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arvind Sanger, founder and managing partner of Geosphere Capital, said that the United States should be developing its own rare earths and minerals, although gaining the know-how will take time, and overcoming “NIMBYism” (not in my backyard-ism) is a challenge. Sanger emphasized that we must continue to use “denser sources of energy” to catalyze the energy transition over the next decade. In particular, Sanger noted that “for every transition technology, steel is needed,” and steel is made in furnaces that use coal and natural gas. “It's completely woolly-headed to think we can just go to a zero-fossil fuel future in a hurry,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topic of power markets occupied another panel, which focused on ways to ensure the distribution of reliable and affordable zero-carbon energy. Integrating intermittent resources such as wind and solar into the grid requires a suite of retail markets and new digital tools, said Anuradha Annaswamy, director of MIT’s Active-Adaptive Control Laboratory. Tim Schittekatte, a postdoc at the MIT Sloan School of Management, proposed auctions as a way of insuring consumers against periods of high market costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another panel described the very different investment needs of new energy startups, such as longer research and development phases. Hooisweng Ow, technology principal at Eni Next LLC Ventures, which is developing drilling technology for geothermal energy, recommends joint development and partnerships to reduce risk. Michael Kearney SM '11, PhD '19, SM '19 is a partner at The Engine, a venture firm built by MIT investing in path-breaking technology to solve the toughest challenges in climate and other problems. Kearney believes the emergence of new technologies and markets will bring on “a labor transition on an order of magnitude never seen before in this country,” he said. “Workforce development is not a natural zone for startups … and this will have to change.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supporting the global South&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opportunities and challenges of the energy transition look quite different in the developing world. In conversation with Robert Armstrong, Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, the coordinating minister for maritime affairs and investment of the Republic of Indonesia, reported that his “nation is rich with solar, wind, and energy transition minerals like nickel and copper,” but cannot on its own tackle developing renewable energy or reducing carbon emissions and improving grid infrastructure. “Education is a top priority, and we are very far behind in high technologies,” he said. “We need help and support from MIT to achieve our target,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technologies that could springboard Indonesia and other nations of the global South toward their climate goals are emerging in MITEI-supported projects and at young companies MITEI helped spawn. Among the promising innovations unveiled at the conference are new materials and designs for cooling buildings in hot climates and reducing the environmental costs of construction, and a sponge-like substance that passively sucks moisture out of the air to lower the energy required for running air conditioners in humid climates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other ideas on the move from lab to market have great potential for industrialized nations as well, such as a computational framework for maximizing the energy output of ocean-based wind farms; a process for using ammonia as a renewable fuel with no CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions; long-duration energy storage derived from the oxidation of iron; and a laser-based method for unlocking geothermal steam to drive power plants.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: Since this event was held on Oct. 7, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has continued to evolve, including airstrikes on Ukrainian cities following an explosion that damaged a key bridge linking Russia to Crimea. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than seven months after Russia invaded Ukraine, the battlefield map has shown recent progress for Ukrainian forces — and yet, the war remains destructive within the country and perilous for the world, with few signs that a rapid end to the conflict is possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was the conclusion of an MIT panel of experts on Ukraine and Russia held Friday, based on both Ukraine’s recent military success and a strong sense that Russian President Vladimir Putin is very reluctant to endure a public climbdown from his clear goal of controlling Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="descnormal"&gt;“Is this war going to end any time soon? I don’t think so,” said Volodymyr Dubovyk, an associate professor of international relations and director of the Center for International Studies at Odesa I. I. Mechnikov National University in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="descnormal"&gt;He added: “Instead of actually quitting and saying, “Okay, we’re done, we’re quitting, let’s sit down and [find] some kind of a peaceful resolution, he [Putin] is doubling down. That’s the kind of person that he is. He’s made a lot of mistakes, he’s cornered, with no clear exit strategy for him or offramp … yet he is still hoping to be able to turn this around.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="descnormal"&gt;Michael Kofman, a senior research scientist at the Center for Naval Analyses, and a fellow at the Kennan Institute of the Woodrow Wilson International Center in Washington, warned against complacency among Ukraine’s allies and supporters, now that Ukraine has been able to stand up to Russia in military terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="descnormal"&gt;“Ukraine has the initiative, and at this stage on the battlefield it also very much has the momentum,” Kofman said. “It’s been able to convert its advantage in manpower and morale, together with Western military substance, into much greater combat power. Ukraine has demonstrated the ability to conduct concurrent offensives on different fronts. … It’s much easier for the Ukrainian military to shift forces within Ukraine from one theater of operations to another, rather than it is for Russia to move units around, back and forth, to try to defend different areas.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="descnormal"&gt;That said, Kofman added, “I also fear that too many people have begun to assume, because Ukraine is winning the war, that the war has already been won.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, with Ukraine heavily dependent on military aid from its allies, Steven Simon, the Robert E. Wilhelm Fellow at the MIT Center for International Studies (CIS), pointed out that U.S. public sentiment has actually moved in favor of Ukraine support in recent months, as championed by U.S. President Joe Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="descnormal"&gt;“Biden has the political wind at his back,” Simon said, noting that one poll last week showed 73 percent of Americans (albeit with a partisan split) agreeing that the U.S. should continue to support Ukraine, a number up since the summer. “From the administration’s perspective, there is a lot to like.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event, “An Update on Russia’s War with Ukraine,” was the latest Starr Forum, MIT’s regular event series on foreign policy, international relations, and global affairs, organized by CIS. This event was co-sponsored by CIS, the MIT Security Studies Program (SSP), and the MIT-Eurasia program in the MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives (MISTI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event’s moderators were Carol Saivetz, a senior advisor in SSP and an expert on Soviet and Russian foreign policy; and Elizabeth Wood, a professor of history at MIT, author of the 2016 book “Roots of Russia’s War in Ukraine,” and co-director of the MISTI MIT-Eurasia Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the early months of the war saw significant Russian advances in multiple areas of Ukraine, the tide has turned since then. A recent Ukrainian counteroffensive in the country’s north has pushed Russian troops back across the border and has extended to provinces in the Donbas region, the site of much industrial activity. Over the last week, Ukraine has also taken back 150 square miles of land in the Kherson province in the country’s south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this progress — or perhaps because of it — the prospects for the war dragging on or escalating may have increased. Putin’s decision to mobilize more Russians through a military draft will bring additional personnel to the front, possibly lengthening the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“General mobilization, the added manpower could, potentially, extend the war,” Kofman said. However, he added, “Mobilization would have been a much more dangerous development in this war had it taken place in April,” when Russia was in a stronger position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, a ground campaign going badly for Russia has heightened fears that it could resort to using some of its nuclear weapons in Ukraine. That might be an unlikely scenario in absolute terms, Kofman noted, but continued military losses might continue to raise the possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The risk of nuclear escalation is very real, [but] it’s not necessarily as high as I think it’s being portrayed publicly,” Kofman said. “It’s also not [necessarily true] that if Russia’s losing, Putin’s going to use nuclear weapons.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Simon noted, it is also unlikely that a coup or attempt at regime change in Russia would be prompted by the war, because of the way Putin has prevented other groups or elites within Russia from amassing capacity to act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘This regime is coup-proofed,” said Simon, who served as the National Security Council (NSC) senior director for the Middle East and North Africa during the Obama administration and NSC senior director for counterterrorism during the Clinton administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is in a better situation than it appeared in the spring, and certainly in the very first days of the invasion, when it looked as if Ukraine’s democratic government led by president Volodymyr Zelensky, might not remain intact. Still, as Dubovyk emphasized, Ukraine very much remains in the throes of war, and needs continued aid in all forms — military and civilian — from allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is very difficult to deal with the ongoing onslaught,” Dubovyk said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added: “One thing that we would really not like to see is for people to lose interest [in] this war, and not to care about it any more, and not to have a sustained interest in helping Ukraine to withstand this pressure and aggression from Russia.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Jung Jae Kwon: Questioning the nuclear umbrella</title>

  <description><![CDATA[Dissatisfied with security guarantees from the US, America’s junior allies want greater control over their own defenses.]]></description>

    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2022/questioning-nuclear-umbrella-jung-jae-kwon-0909</guid>
        <dc:creator>Leda Zimmerman | Department of Political Science</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many of America’s allies have little faith that huddling under America’s nuclear umbrella will keep them safe. “The conventional wisdom has been that the threat of nuclear retaliation by the U.S. is enough to defend our junior non-nuclear allies,” says Jung Jae Kwon, a political science doctoral student at MIT. “But this threat is not as credible as is often believed, and the allies do not simply want to depend on it for their security.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kwon has been researching defense strategies of American client states, gathering data to analyze the security policy and military postures of frontline states that came to rely on U.S. nuclear protection during and after the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholars in the security field argue that reliance on nuclear deterrence makes sense in a world full of uncertainties, and that formal treaties invoking this deterrent offer ample reassurance to junior allies. But Kwon’s historical studies show that “many allies want enough capability of their own to prevail when a conflict begins.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His dissertation illuminates an area of security studies that has not been deeply investigated: what America’s allies believe they need to guarantee their survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The literature on extended nuclear deterrence tends to focus on only the American perspective,” he says. “No one has advanced the argument that America’s allies want to be sure they have a plan and can respond to an immediate threat.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an era increasingly rocked by superpower jockeying, climate, energy, and pandemic crises, Kwon believes that his research “has immediate implications for today’s most pressing security questions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nuclear: not a one-stop solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kwon arrived at MIT in 2017 broadly interested in the drivers of war and conditions that bring peace. With the guidance of security studies faculty Barry Posen, Ford International Professor of Political Science; Vipin Narang, the Frank Stanton Professor of Nuclear Security and Political Science (now serving in the Biden Administration as principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for space policy); and Taylor Fravel, the Arthur and Ruth Sloan Professor of Political Science, Kwon sharpened his focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I wanted to understand how non-nuclear states achieve security,” he says. “As a devastating threat to human civilization, nuclear weapons represent an ongoing challenge that must be faced, especially as nations like Iran and North Korea continue to develop their own nuclear programs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the security perspectives of America’s non-nuclear allies and how their military postures shift in response to heightened levels of risk, Kwon decided to investigate South Korea, Taiwan, West Germany, and Norway — nations that began sheltering under the U.S. nuclear umbrella during the Cold War. Digging into these countries’ diplomatic records, and other archival sources, he has learned that these states did not embrace nuclear deterrence as a one-stop solution to their security needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When conflicts arise, these allies don’t want to give up territory or lose anything,” says Kwon. “They ask for plans where they have a viable option for victory.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example Kwon cites is South Korea, where the U.S. stationed tactical nuclear weapons. “But the U.S. didn’t give South Korea any control over the deterrent, no mechanisms for coordination when it came to nuclear planning,” he says. As a result, South Korea tries to maintain superiority in conventional power against North Korea. “It’s their fate; they don’t just want to rely on the U.S. for security,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And West Germany, America’s most important ally in Western Europe during the Cold War, “wanted assurance from the U.S. that nuclear weapons would be used first,” says Kwon. “They were overwhelmed by conventional Soviet military power, and wanted to assert more control over the U.S. nuclear threat.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the end of the Cold War and dissolution of the Soviet Union, European allies grew less concerned about attacks from their neighbors, and more content to rely on the U.S. nuclear deterrent. But recently, the war in Ukraine has shifted defense postures, says Kwon, prompting allies’ calls for greater conventional military presence along Europe’s eastern border. In East Asia, North Korean nuclear buildup has led to South Korean demands for a greater U.S. commitment and a more visible nuclear presence. “If South Koreans feel they are not provided with sufficient capability, you’ll see more tensions surface in the relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Military service and a personal reckoning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Kwon grew up in Seoul, South Korea, he did not become interested in international relations and security matters until much later. His family business was front and center, and like other South Korean households, they were desensitized to the “constant danger represented by North Korea,” says Kwon. He attended a boarding school in the United States, then Harvard University, where he concentrated in government and contemplated a career in law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that changed with Kwon’s mandatory military service, which began after his sophomore year. Initially placed with an infantry division as a mechanic, Kwon sought out and won an opportunity to serve as a translator on a South Korean unit of a U.N. peacekeeping mission in South Sudan in December 2013. Then civil war broke out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It suddenly became a huge humanitarian mission, with tens of thousands of refugees flooding in to escape the shooting, and all hell broke loose, literally,” he says. “We were caught in the middle of it, with shells falling into our compound, and I was caring for patients, and then we were helping to bury the dead.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shaken by this experience, with a newly awakened interest in matters of war, peace, and international relations, Kwon returned to Harvard for his junior year. He turned his attention to China and its expanding impact on the world. Immediately after graduation, Kwon left for a master’s program at Peking University, where he wrote a thesis on Chinese peacekeepers in United Nations missions. He arrived at MIT straight from China, to pursue East Asian politics and security issues, and his dissertation topic on the security of non-nuclear allies of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Covid pandemic slowed his research, Kwon has been methodically excavating historical records for useful data. “Reading diplomatic records is my biggest pleasure, because history comes to life,” he says. “Examining correspondence between Eisenhower and Chiang Kai-Shek makes the topics I’m studying more real.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extracting historical data for his case studies has been slow, painstaking work, but based on the research he’s completed to date, Kwon believes that both scholars and security experts will find his insights useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My biggest takeaway is that allies won’t be assured simply by gestures of solidarity, formal alliance treaties, or even the huge nuclear arsenal the U.S. possesses,” he says. “Allies face specific security challenges and will seek the capability to enable them to prevail when conflicts arise, raising the likelihood of arms races.” If the U.S. fails to provide the capability they seek, “which won’t happen on the cheap,” he says, “we might see attempts by these allies to build their own nuclear weapons.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Promoting systemic change in the Middle East, the “MIT way”</title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2022/promoting-systemic-change-middle-east-mit-way-0825</link>
  <description><![CDATA[In a recent MISTI course, students engaged on collaborative solutions to climate, health care, and economic development in the Middle East.]]></description>

    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2022/promoting-systemic-change-middle-east-mit-way-0825</guid>
        <dc:creator>MISTI</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Middle East is a region that is facing complicated challenges. MIT programs have been committed to building scalable methodologies through which students and the broader MIT community can learn and make an impact. These processes ensure programs work alongside others across cultures to support change aligned with their needs. Through MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives (MISTI), faculty and staff at the Institute continue to build opportunities to connect with and support the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this spirit, MISTI launched the &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/embarking-upon-leadership-journey-1108"&gt;Leaders Journey&lt;/a&gt; Workshop in 2021. This program partnered MIT students with Palestinian and Israeli alumni from three associate organizations: Middle East Entrepreneurs for Tomorrow (&lt;a href="https://www.meet.org/"&gt;MEET&lt;/a&gt;), Our Generation Speaks (&lt;a href="https://www.ogspeaks.com/"&gt;OGS&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href="https://www.tech2peace.com/"&gt;Tech2Peace&lt;/a&gt;. Teams met monthly to engage with speakers and work with one another to explore the best ways to leverage science, technology, and entrepreneurship across borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on the success of this workshop, the program piloted a for-credit course: SP.258 (MISTI: Middle East Cross-Border Development and Leadership) in fall 2021. The course involved engaging with subject matter experts through five mini-consulting projects in collaboration with regional stakeholders. Topics included climate, health care, and economic development. The course was co-instructed by associate director of the MIT Regional Entrepreneurship Acceleration Program (REAP) Sinan AbuShanab, managing director of MISTI programs in the Middle East David Dolev, and Kathleen Schwind '19, with MIT CIS/ MISTI Research Affiliate &lt;a href="https://www.koltai.co/about"&gt;Steven Koltai&lt;/a&gt; as lead mentor. The course also drew support from alumni mentors and regional industry partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course was developed during the height of the pandemic and thus successfully leveraged the intense culture of online engagement prevalent at the time by layering in-person coursework with strategic digital group engagement. Pedagogically, the structure was inspired by multiple MIT methodologies: MISTI preparation and training courses, Sloan Action Learning, REAP/REAL multi-party stakeholder model, the Media Lab Learning Initiative, and the multicultural framework of associate organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We worked to develop a series of aims and a methodology that would enrich MIT students and their peers in the region and support the important efforts of Israelis and Palestinians to make systemic change,” said Dolev.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the on-campus sessions, MIT students explored the region's political and historical complexities and the meaning of being a global leader and entrepreneur. Guest presenters included: Boston College Associate Professor Peter Krause (MIT Security Studies Program alumnus), Gilad Rosenzweig (MITdesignX), Ari Jacobovits (MIT-Africa), and Mollie Laffin-Rose Agbiboa (MIT-REAP). Group projects focused on topics that fell under three key regional verticals: water, health care, and economic development. The teams were given a technical or business challenge they were tasked with solving. These challenges were sourced directly from for-profit and nonprofit organizations in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This was a unique opportunity for me to learn so much about the area I live in, work on a project together with people from the ‘other side,’ MIT students, and incredible mentors,” shared a participant from the region. “Furthermore, getting a glimpse of the world of MIT was a great experience for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For their final presentations, teams pitched their solutions, including their methodology for researching/addressing the problem, a description of solutions to be applied, what is needed to execute the idea itself, and potential challenges encountered. Teams received feedback and continued to deepen their experience in cross-cultural teamwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As an education manager, I needed guidance with these digital tools and how to approach them," says an EcoPeace representative. "The MIT program provided me with clear deliverables I can now implement in my team's work."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This course has broadened my knowledge of conflicts, relationships, and how geography plays an important role in the region,” says an MIT student participant. “Moving forward, I feel more confident working with business and organizations to develop solutions for problems in real time, using the skills I have to supplement the project work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Layers of engagement with mentors, facilitators, and whole-team leadership ensured that participants gained project management experience, learning objectives were met, and professional development opportunities were available. Each team was assigned an MIT-MEET alumni mentor with whom they met throughout the course. Mentors coached the teams on methods for managing a client project and how to collaborate for successful completion. Joint sessions with MIT guest speakers deepened participants' regional understanding of water, health care, economic development, and their importance in the region. Speakers included: &lt;a href="https://legatum.mit.edu/entrepreneur/mohamed-aburawi/"&gt;Mohamed Aburawi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/phil-budden"&gt;Phil Budden&lt;/a&gt; (MIT-REAP) &lt;a href="https://www.koltai.co/about"&gt;Steven Koltai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/shari-loessberg"&gt;Shari Loessberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://legatum.mit.edu/management/dina-h-sherif/"&gt;Dina Sherif&lt;/a&gt; (MIT Legatum Center, &lt;a href="https://jwafs.mit.edu/people/greg-sixt"&gt;Greg Sixt&lt;/a&gt; (J-WAFS), and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shriyasrinivasan/"&gt;Shriya Srinivasan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The program is unlike any other I've come across,” says one of the alumni mentors. “The chance for MIT students to work directly with peers from the region, to propose and create technical solutions to real problems on the ground, and partner with local organizations is an incredibly meaningful opportunity. I wish I had been able to participate in something like this when I was at MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each team also assigned a fellow group member as a facilitator, who served as the main point of contact for the team and oversaw project management: organizing workstreams, ensuring deadlines were met, and mediating any group disagreements. This model led to successful project outcomes and&amp;nbsp;innovative suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The superb work of the MISTI group gave us a critical eye and made significant headway on a product that can hopefully be a game changer to over 150 Israeli and Palestinian organizations," says a representative from Alliance for Middle East Peace (ALLMEP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leadership team meetings included MIT staff and Israeli and Palestinian leadership of the partner organizations for discussing process, content, recent geopolitical developments, and how to adapt the class to the ongoing changing situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The topic of Palestine/Israel is contentious: globally, in the region, and also, at times, on the MIT campus,” says Dolev. “I myself have questioned how we can make a systemic impact with our partners from the region. How can we be side-by-side on that journey for the betterment of all? I have now seen first-hand how this multilayered model can work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives (MISTI) is MIT's hub for global experiences. MISTI's unparalleled internship, research, teaching, and study abroad programs offer students unique experiences that bring MIT's one-of-a-kind education model to life in countries around the world.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;MISTI programs are carefully designed to complement on-campus course work and research, and rigorous, country-specific preparation enables students to forge cultural connections and play a role in addressing important global challenges while abroad. Students come away from their experiences with invaluable perspectives that inform their education, career, and worldview. MISTI embodies MIT's commitment to global engagement and prepares students to thrive in an increasingly interconnected world.&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:creator>Security Studies Program</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;More than 30 congressional and executive branch staffers were hosted by MIT’s Security Studies Program (SSP) for a series of panels and a keynote address focused on contemporary national security issues.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organized by the Security Studies Program, the Executive Branch and Congressional Staff Seminar was held from Wednesday, April 20m to Friday, April 22, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The program, supported by a generous grant from the Raymond Frankel Foundation, is hosted by MIT every other year to encourage interaction and exchange between scholars studying national security and policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staff members from the U.S. House of Representatives, the Senate, and the Congressional Research Service were joined by more than 15 MIT SSP faculty members and research affiliates. Each of them is an expert on one of a broad range of topics, from China’s ambitions to great-power competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year’s program included a guided tour of the MIT Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington, Massachusetts, four intensive panels with SSP faculty and affiliates, and a keynote address by Admiral John Richardson, the former chief of naval operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keynote address&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his address, Richardson argued the United States is facing two simultaneous revolutions that have the potential to reshape the world. First, a political revolution of rising powers is returning the world to multipolarity and spreading authoritarianism. Second, a technological revolution of interconnected new technologies, from artificial intelligence to quantum computing, promises not only to increase speed and efficiency, but also to allow for entirely new capabilities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richardson compared the current moment to two points in history: the turn of the 19th century and the beginning of the Cold War. In both periods, he said, the United States faced intertwined political and technological revolutions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In each case, he said, the U.S. and its allies prevailed. This success was won in both the political and technological spheres.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those areas, there was a sense of existential urgency that enabled a more adaptable and learning-based approach to the rapid changes of the Cold War, he said. In the end, the United States benefited from a coherent strategy to address worldwide changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current challenges, Richardson said, demand a similar sense of urgency, adaptability, and learning if the U.S. is to prevail in preserving its influence in the world, and its quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The changing international order&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a panel on the “Changing International Order,” staffers heard from Ford International Professor of Political Science Barry Posen, SSP Senior Advisor Carol Saivetz, and Jonathan Kirshner, a professor of political science and international studies at Boston College.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Posen focused his remarks on Russia and China’s growing power relative to the United States, in the context of the 2008 financial crisis, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the war in Ukraine. Kirshner identified the domestic politics of key participants in the international order, especially domestic dysfunction in the United States, as the chief driver of change. Saivetz offered several hypotheses on the cause of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which include pushing back against the expansion of NATO and the European Union, the desire for great power status, concerns about a liberal democracy on its borders, and the influence of the Russian Orthodox Church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New tools of statecraft&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A panel on “New Tools of Statecraft” featured remarks by Richard Nielsen, associate professor of political science at MIT, Mariya Grinberg, assistant professor of political science at MIT, and Joel Brenner, senior advisor to MIT SSP. MIT’s R. David Edelman, director of the Project on Technology, Economy and National Security and Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory affiliate, chaired the panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nielsen discussed the role of U.S. influence in a world beset by misinformation. He emphasized that the internet is more fragmented than it has ever been, and America’s ability to shape people’s opinions through the internet is extremely limited. Grinberg, an expert on conflict economies, addressed what policy changes are necessary — and what policy changes were unnecessary — in response to the Covid-19 pandemic’s effects on markets. Brenner observed that many existing tools of statecraft are not “new,” but the speed, coordination, and synchronization of tools is new, as demonstrated by both the Russians and the Ukrainians in the ongoing war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China’s growing ambitions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A panel on “China’s Growing Ambitions” featured remarks by MIT SSP director and Arthur and Ruth Sloan Professor of Political Science M. Taylor Fravel along with two SSP alumni: Joseph Torigian PhD '16, an assistant professor with the School of International Service at American University, and Fiona Cunningham PhD '18, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Torigian suggested that Chinese General Secretary Xi Jinping’s views are likely a balance between pursuing the Communist Party’s ideals and mission with a deep skepticism of radical policies, and the kind of leftism and radicalism associated with events such as the Cultural Revolution. Xi is ideological, he said, but is flexible. Cunningham spoke broadly on China’s ambitions, and concluded with an argument that the U.S. needs to do more work to implement a more competitive Indo-Pacific policy, especially in terms of trade, and that U.S. officials should work to protect and strengthen existing channels of communication so that they can be functional in a crisis. Fravel discussed recent military changes in China. He noted that China adopted a new military strategy in 2019, which identifies the U.S. and Taiwan as principal adversaries, but stated that this was fundamentally not much more than top-level cosmetic changes to the 2014 military strategy in order to help cement Xi’s role as a military leader.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The new nuclear era&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “New Nuclear Era” panel featured three MIT faculty and affiliates: Senior Research Associate Jim Walsh, Principal Research Scientist Eric Heginbotham, and Caitlin Talmadge PhD '11, an associate professor with the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University and an SSP alumna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heginbotham discussed the increasing number and variety of roles that nuclear weapons play in international affairs, emphasizing how multipolarity and nuclear proliferation create “nested security dilemmas.” Talmadge similarly highlighted the complexity of the deterrence environment with multiple, multi-sided nuclear competitions occurring at once. Walsh framed the war in Ukraine as a reminder of nuclear danger that motivates the public both to “hug nuclear weapons more closely in a more dangerous world” and to “reduce nuclear danger before unimaginably bad things happen.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Eleanor Freund receives Jeanne Guillemin Prize</title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2022/eleanor-freund-receives-jeanne-guillemin-prize-0517</link>
  <description><![CDATA[Awarded by the Center for International Studies, the prize will help support the PhD candidate's dissertation research on Chinese foreign and security policy.]]></description>

    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2022/eleanor-freund-receives-jeanne-guillemin-prize-0517</guid>
        <dc:creator>Michelle English | MIT Center for International Studies</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The daughter of an American diplomat, &lt;a href="https://polisci.mit.edu/people/eleanor-freund" target="_blank"&gt;Eleanor Freund&lt;/a&gt; spent most of her childhood living abroad in such places as Madagascar, Ghana, South Africa, and Austria. These experiences, she explains, led to an early interest in politics and international relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Whether in South Africa, which was emerging from decades of racial discrimination and violence under apartheid, or Austria, which seemed practiced at navigating Cold War divisions between East and West, I was captivated by the import and impact of politics. I started college knowing that I wanted to major in political science and never doubted that decision.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freund, a PhD candidate in the MIT Department of Political Science, is the recipient of this year’s Jeanne Guillemin Prize at the MIT Center for International Studies (CIS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The annual prize supports women pursuing doctorate degrees in international relations — a field that has long been dominated by men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeanne Guillemin, a veteran colleague of CIS and a senior advisor in the Security Studies Program (SSP), endowed the fund shortly before her death in 2019. An expert in biological warfare, Guillemin’s groundbreaking work included an epidemiological inquiry into the 1979 anthrax outbreak in the Soviet Union and an investigation into the 2001 anthrax letters attack in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funds from the prize will be used to support Freund’s dissertation research on Chinese foreign and security policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through case studies, fieldwork abroad, and archival research, Freund aims to produce one of the first comprehensive historical studies on China’s alliances with other states.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This information could help contribute to a better understanding of how Chinese leaders evaluate threats and cooperate with other states to address these threats. It could also serve as an important resource for policymakers as they attempt to evaluate China’s current behavior, anticipate its future behavior, and avoid miscalculating during moments of crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embracing the China challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freund became interested in China through international relations classes at college, when it became apparent that China would define the 21st century and dominate the attention of American diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I quickly realized that ensuring the relationship between the United States and China was peaceful and productive would require contending with a relationship defined by decades of mistrust. For anyone interested in foreign policy, there could hardly be a more meaningful challenge,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after graduating from the University of California at Berkeley, Freund moved to Beijing to study Chinese. This led to a host of other experiences, including jobs at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and at Harvard’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, a master’s degree from Tsinghua University as part of the Schwarzman Scholars program, and time at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When considering PhD programs, MIT was a clear first choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“First, the political science department, like the rest of the Institute, is imbued with the guiding principle of education in service of practical application. That’s an important orienting philosophy for me. Second, the department offers substantial faculty expertise in my areas of interest — Chinese foreign policy and Asian security — and first-rate training in international relations and security studies more generally.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT is among the few universities in the United States that provides the opportunity for graduate students in political science to specialize in security studies. A unique feature of SSP is its integration of technical and political analysis of national and international security problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This training is crucial to producing the civilian expertise that enables effective oversight of the military and clear-eyed foreign policy decision-making, explains Freund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SSP also has a long track record of recruiting and training women interested in security studies.&amp;nbsp;Many of these women have gone on to become successful academics and policymakers, including the current U.S. deputy secretary of defense, Kathleen Hicks PhD '10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That legacy is a source of inspiration to Freund, who envisions a lifelong career in academia or government helping the United States navigate its relationship with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is an honor to receive an award named for Jeanne Guillemin,” says Freund. “I am particularly inspired by the tenacity and compassion she demonstrated while investigating the cause of the 1979 anthrax outbreak in Sverdlovsk. Although I never had the chance to meet her, the written account of her fieldwork in Russia illustrates her dedication to the principles of scientific research, her perseverance in overcoming the obstacles she encountered along the way, and her deep empathy for the victims and their families. I plan to use the award to fund my own fieldwork in Asia next year and hope to bring some of her passion and persistence to that experience.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>When dueling narratives deepen a divide</title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2022/iran-us-relations-starr-forum-0516</link>
  <description><![CDATA[At the latest Starr Forum, John Tirman and his collaborators describe the cultural framework that has worsened US-Iran relations.]]></description>
  <pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2022 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2022/iran-us-relations-starr-forum-0516</guid>
        <dc:creator>Peter Dizikes | MIT News Office</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For more than four decades, the U.S. and Iran have had a relentlessly poor relationship. To be sure, it is hardly a shock that tensions would run high between the countries following the hostage crisis of 1979-1981, when Iran held more than 50 U.S. diplomats in captivity for 444 days. Even so, little progress has been made in U.S.-Iran relations in subsequent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this? One factor could be that the dominant stories framing each country’s politics combine to inhibit any kind of lasting cooperation with each other. That’s the thesis of a new book co-authored by John Tirman, executive director and a principal research scientist at the MIT Center for International Studies (CIS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book, “Republics of Myth: National Narratives and the U.S.-Iran Conflict,” just published by Johns Hopkins University Press, explores this joint history of identities at odds with each other. The authors identify key moments when U.S.-Iran tensions became further heightened and opportunities for détente dwindled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing these narratives is “fundamental to how we understand the confrontation that we have seen over the years,” Tirman said on Wednesday during the latest iteration of MIT’s Starr Forum, a public event series on international affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran’s dominant national narrative, Tirman said, stems from the story of Imam Hussein, the prophet’s Mohammed’s grandson, who was killed by outsiders, thus giving Iran a “key story of noble sacrifice. Among other attributes, the narrative warns of foreign intrigue and betrayal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the U.S., Tirman suggested, “the master narrative of America derives from the myth of the frontier,” with expansion, wars, and the establishment of rule over others. Thus the U.S.-Iran conflict thus features one country which is “expansionist at its core,” pitted against another that is “deeply suspicious of foreign influence, demanding respect,” with little political space for leaders to deviate from these postures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The narratives have had this inimical effect on relations between the two countries,” Tirman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missed opportunities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hosted by CIS, the Starr Forum features talks by experts from inside and outside of MIT, about international relations and global politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Wednesday’s event, Tirman was joined by both of his co-authors: Hussein Banai, an associate professor of international studies at the Hamilton Lugar School of Global and International Studies at Indiana University and a research affiliate at CIS; and Malcolm Byrne, deputy director and director of research for the nongovernmental National Security Archive, based at George Washington University. Byrne is also a research affiliate at CIS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book, the scholars noted, draws, in part, on input they received at a series of four conferences they helped organized in recent years, where officials who have been direct participants in U.S.-Iran relations detailed their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their remarks, Tirman, Banai, and Byrne mentioned some of the key events that have further damaged U.S.-Iran relations since the hostage crisis ended, from the 1988 downing of a Iranian civilian airliner by the U.S. military, to the fact that Iran helped organize the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing of American military personnel (and civilians) in Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Byrne also listed “missed opportunities” to improve relations between the U.S. and Iran, including the period soon after the Iran-Iraq War ended in 1988. Another was the period soon after terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, given that Iran and Afghanistan’s Taliban regime were adversaries. In 2003, the U.S. received a proposal from Iran, via diplomatic intermediaries, suggesting a “grand bargain” with Iran involving nuclear security, a cessation of Iran’s support for terror activites, an end to sanctions, and more. It was never seriously pursued, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The more we looked into this concept, and studied the history and dynamics of the relationship, it became clear that those missed windows in many cases had a connection to the more fundamental ideas of national narratives, that they could be explained by the impact of the belief systems that both sides held so closely,” Byrne said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those belief systems helped feed what Byrne called “the fundamental ignorance” that has hampered this bilateral relationship. Byrne stated that U.S. officials often regarded Iran’s decisions as indecipherable, and coming out of a “black box,” while Iranian leaders also failed to grasp U.S. goals. As he noted, one Iranian offer to reorient its backing for terror activities, away from American targets and toward Europe, was made without the understanding that it would still be highly unacceptable to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add in “the lack of formal communications channels” between the countries, Byrne said, and there has been “the persistence of a sense of distrust of the intentions of the other side,” with few ways to improve matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nuclear security: The 2015 deal and its dismantling&amp;nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For his part, Banai also emphasized that the cultural framework through which the U.S. and Iran view each other has greatly influenced high-level decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s very clear to us that the narrative that each government, each set of elites that are key players in maintaining this relationship, has curated over time, plays an enormously powerful role in conducting all sorts of direct, indirect, proxy relations between these two countries,” Banai said. As an example, he added, “The fact that the Islamic Republic [of Iran] is vociferous in its wish that the state of Israel disappear from the map of the Middle East [has] confirmed to the United States that this is a pariah, outlaw regime that has to be tamed; this is a frontier for the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At times, he noted, those perceptions can supercede what may be in the national interest of each country. The most noteworthy instance of cooperation between the U.S. and Iran in the last four decades came during the Obama administration, in the form of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JPCOA) in 2015, the treaty that limited Iran’s nuclear capabilities while lifting certain sanctions on Iran. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration then withdrew from the JCPOA in 2018, “with gusto, and with the support of the entirety of the Republican Party and even some Democrats such as Chuck Schumer in the Senate as well,” Banai noted. The fact that the nuclear security deal would provoke such a quick policy backlash, Banai added, “really highlights in a very dramatic way how the exception ends up proving the rule.” That is, cooperation was soon replaced by mutual distrust again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As matters stand, he added, any future acquisition of nuclear capability by Iran may prove the most difficult testing point of this entire fraught international relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It will put the two countries on a far different, perhaps alarming trajectory, because this narrative [would be] weaponized in a way we’ve never seen before,” Banai said.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has global implications. A panel of MIT foreign policy experts convened on Monday to examine those reverberations — on European domestic politics, the refugee crisis, great-power relations, and nuclear security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently Ukraine has experienced widespread devastation, and millions of Ukrainians have fled their homes as refugees. Many countries have allied to enact stiff sanctions on Russia, and global sentiment has been with Ukraine. But as Monday’s discussion made clear, the global effects of the war may depend on how it evolves. If Russia ends up waging a “frozen conflict,” occupying some areas of the country indefinitely, with less visible devastation, it could produce a different long-term response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in the current climate, Hungarian President Viktor Orban claimed an electoral victory this week, perhaps showing some limits to the European backlash against leaders with connections to Russian President Vladimir Putin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One idea was that this war was going to end illiberalism in European states,” observed Roger Peterson, Arthur and Ruth Sloan Professor of Political Science at MIT, during Monday’s event. “I think that's probably overblown.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Petersen added, even though Ukrainians have “won the information war” over the invasion, generating massive international sympathy, their struggle could soon become “routinized,” generating a less energized response in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If it [turns] into some frozen conflict, this could be years and years of war,” Petersen said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event, “The Wider Implications of the War in Ukraine,” took place online as the latest installment of MIT’s Starr Forum, an ongoing series of public discussions on pressing foreign policy issues, held by the Center for International Studies (CIS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides Petersen, the participants on the panel were Jacqueline Bhabha, a professor of the practice of health and human rights at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health; Joel Brenner, a senior research fellow at CIS and former head of U.S. counterintelligence under the Director of National Intelligence; Taylor Fravel, Arthur and Ruth Sloan Professor of Political Science at MIT and director of the MIT Security Studies Program (SSP); and Jim Walsh, a research associate in SSP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel’s co-chairs and moderators were Carol Saivetz, senior advisor in SSP; and Elizabeth Wood, professor of history at MIT and co-director of the MISTI MIT-Russia Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refugees and cyber issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An estimated 4.5 million Ukrainians have been displaced since the war started in late February, with many becoming refugees in other European countries. But the European Union is allowing many Ukrainians to stay in other countries for a year or longer, a policy Bhabha endorsed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The EU’s response is something which sets a wonderful precent for refugee flows and will at least in part mitigate the tragedy,” Bhabha said. At the same time, she noted, “The challenge is immense, because of the scale of arrival [of refugees], and the scale of harm and devastation are huge.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, whether the war in Ukraine sets a precedent for openness toward refugees is still quite uncertain. Bhabha noted that Venezuelans, Syrians, and Afghans, among others, have not received the same welcome in Europe as refugees of European origin. In any case, she added, national leaders should be prepared for further refugee crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“States should anticipate unpredictable needs [regarding refugees] rather than always being behind the curve,” Bhabha said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brenner, focusing his remarks on cyber warfare, noted that Russia has not really deployed the kind of disruptive technology attacks many expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This looks like a puzzle at first, but it’s really not,” Brenner said. “If you’re blowing up the hospital, and if you’re blowing up the power plant, taking out its cyber network really is sort of beside the point.” He added: “We’re in a war that has cyber aspects to it, and it’s anything but a standalone cyber event.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Brenner noted, Russia is not having unqualified success in the cyber arena at the moment. Ukraine has obtained data about Russian military operations, and the U.S. Congress passed new measures recently that may “make resilience greater” against Russian operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aligned with China&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most pressing issues in global geopolitics is how the relationship between Russia and China will be affected by the war in Ukraine. China has not joined the economic sanctions against Russia, but it has not undercut them, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Even though China opposes the sanctions, China so far does not appear to be helping Russia to circumvent or overcome them,” Fravel said. “And, in fact, [China] has been quite cautious, seeking to understand the limits of these sanctions, so that its companies and firms do not get entangled in them, because that ultimately would be bad for Chinese business, and [that’s] something that China wants to avoid.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diplomatically, Fravel added, China has hurt its stature among many countries in Europe due to its relationship with Russia. “China has managed very successfully to annoy the one group of countries it was seeking to cultivate as part of its broader response to the United States,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there has been rampant speculation that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine might embolden China to initiate military action against Taiwan. But the problems Russia has encountered in Ukraine might equally well quell China’s likelihood of taking action, Fravel noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Though of course China is not going to abandon any of its ambitions with respect to Taiwan, it may be more cautious, perhaps, in thinking about using the military,” Fravel said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebuilding the relationship, versus the alternative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walsh noted that Russia’s invasion, and Putin’s comments emphasizing Russia’s ability to use its nuclear arsenal, have heightened nuclear fears among more the public more than anything else in the last couple of decades — something that can be quantified through Google search patterns, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Walsh added, “I think the odds of us removing tactical nuclear weapons from Europe have diminished significantly for a period of time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, Walsh said, he would not rule out the U.S. and Russia restarting a diplomatic dialogue over nuclear issues eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think this [the war] is going to go on for a while, and I think that will continue to impede those conversations, but eventually — quietly perhaps at first, but eventually — the two countries will be pressed to talk again to reduce mutual dangers,” Walsh said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brenner also presented a similar conclusion. At the moment, it is hard to see common ground between Russia, on the one hand, and the U.S. and Europe, on the other. But in the future, at some point, with shifts in the situation in Ukraine, the U.S. and Europe might try to reestablish a semblance of normalcy with Russia, if only to prevent an even more troublesome sense of division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This [war] is going to be long, it’s going to be nasty, and could involve a lot of human suffering,” Brenner said. “Remember, it’s hard to think about this, given what the Russians are doing now. But in the long run, we’re not interested in isolating Russia. The question is, can Russia be incorporated into what we in the West think of as a civilized international order? Because, if not, we’re either driving them permanently … into the arms of the Chinese, which is not in our interest, or [Russia may remain] a volatile unsatisfied revanchist state which will continue to cause trouble. We don’t want that.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Reviving war-game scholarship at MIT</title>

  <description><![CDATA[MIT Center for International Studies and Security Studies Program offer new resources for modeling human behavior and decision-making in real-world scenarios.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;War games and crisis simulations are exercises where participants make decisions to simulate real-world behavior. In the field of international security, games are frequently used to study how actors make decisions during conflict, but they can also be used to model human behavior in countless other scenarios.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;War games take place in a “structured-unstructured environment,” according to Benjamin Harris, PhD student in the Department of Political Science and a convener of the MIT Wargaming Working Group at the Center for International Studies (CIS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that the games operate at two levels — an overarching structure conditions what kind of moves players can make, but interactions among team members are unstructured. As a result, people with different backgrounds are forced to engage and learn from each other throughout the simulation. “The game goes where the participants take it,” says Harris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT researchers have been developing the craft of war gaming since the late 1950s. In “&lt;a href="https://cis.mit.edu/publications/magazine/pioneering-role-cis-american-war-gaming"&gt;The Pioneering Role of CIS in American War Gaming&lt;/a&gt;,” Reid Pauly PhD ’19, assistant professor at&amp;nbsp;Brown University and a CIS research affiliate, credits the origins of modern war-gaming methodology in large part to MIT professor Lincoln Bloomfield and other faculty affiliated with CIS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, CIS is again at the center of new developments in the methodology, pedagogy, and application of war gaming. Over the last few years, CIS and the MIT Security Studies Program have responded to an increased demand for war gaming among students and from the policy community. This has resulted in new course offerings, student and faculty-produced research, and on-campus simulations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning through games&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PhD student Suzanne Freeman and Harris started the Wargaming Working Group as a forum for students to engage with the war-gaming community on campus and in policy spaces. Now in its third year, the group has developed a partnership with the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) that brings mid-career military officers and academics together for an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://ssp.mit.edu/news/2020/simulating-war-with-the-mit-wargaming-working-group"&gt;annual simulation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Samuels, Ford International Professor of Political Science and director of CIS, participated in his first crisis simulation in a game organized by Bloomfield, and subsequently organized nearly a dozen large-scale games at MIT in the 1990s through the early 2000s, most focused on&amp;nbsp;Asia-Pacific&amp;nbsp;security dynamics. Eric Heginbotham PhD '04, a principal research scientist at CIS, and Christopher Twomey PhD '05, were active participants. Together, they established the working group’s partnership with NPS, where Twomey is associate&amp;nbsp;professor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, participants worked through a crisis scenario centered on a nuclear reactor meltdown in Taiwan. Teams were assigned to represent Taiwan, China, the United States, and Japan, and the game was designed to tease out how civilian and military sub-teams would communicate during a crisis. Freeman and Harris&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq28vZtg6ig"&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; some of the findings from the war game at Georgetown University in October 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to planning tabletop exercises at MIT, the working group invites speakers from universities and think tanks to present war-gaming research, and held online war games when MIT went virtual due to Covid-19. The working group has been especially successful at bridging the gap between academia and policy, allowing for PhD students and military officers to learn from each other, says Freeman. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For students hoping to further explore the history and practice of war gaming in a classroom setting, MIT now offers “Simulating Global Dynamics and War,” co-taught biennially by Samuels and Heginbotham. Students participate in four war games over the course of the semester — an operational war game, political-military crisis game, experimental game, and a game designed by students as their final project.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the class is designed for security studies students and military fellows, it has included students and practitioners from other fields interested in incorporating gaming into their work. Lessons from the course can be applied to issues such as a global pandemic or refugee crisis, says Heginbotham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For MIT undergraduates taking coursework in political science, war gaming is also a pedagogical tool used to consider the implications of policy decisions. In fall 2021, students in Erik Lin-Greenberg’s National Security Policy class participated in a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MIT_SSP/status/1478431832920182785"&gt;simulation&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;centered around a cyberattack on U.S. soil. Students worked in teams to represent U.S. government agencies at a National Security Council Principals Committee meeting. Lin-Greenberg is assistant professor of political science at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The revival of war gaming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political scientists are increasingly considering how the method of war gaming can be improved and used in research and pedagogy. For scholars of interstate war and nuclear weapons, war gaming is an especially promising research tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, researchers have recognized that “war games and crisis simulations may have had an outsized influence on Cold War policymakers,” says Samuels. “Close, archival, analysis of Cold War games could provide insight into how policy elites thought about nuclear war.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the rise of the experimental method for political analysis has coincided with the revival of war gaming as a research tool, according to Samuels. “Experimental war games allow researchers to derive generalizations about leadership choice under stress,” says Samuels. However, scholars still face challenges related to external validity, or, the extent to which outcomes of war games apply to real-world scenarios.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to advances in experimental war gaming and nuclear simulations, Heginbotham adds that scholars are increasingly applying war gaming to emerging and nontraditional security challenges. “War gaming allows scholars to model complex conflicts, change individual variables, and run multiple iterations,” says Heginbotham. For researchers trying to understand the dynamics of political events, gaming has a number of advantages.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2022, Steven Simon, a former diplomat and National Security Council director now serving as a Robert E Wilhelm Fellow at CIS, wrote an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/13/opinion/january-6-civil-war.html"&gt;opinion piece&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;with Jonathan Stevenson about the need for war gaming focused on U.S. democratic backsliding. For Simon and Stevenson, war gaming is a tool scholars can adopt while studying low-probability but high-risk events like the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They argue, “War games, tabletop exercises, operations research, campaign analyses, conferences and seminars on the prospect of American political conflagration — including insurrection, secession, insurgency, and civil war — should be proceeding at a higher tempo and intensity.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A bright future for war gaming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lin-Greenberg '09, MS '09 joined the Department of Political Science and the Security Studies Program in 2020 after completing&amp;nbsp;a dissertation that &lt;a href="https://politicalsciencenow.com/erik-lin-greenberg-receives-the-2020-merze-tate-award/"&gt;pioneered the use of experimental wargames in international security research&lt;/a&gt;. As part of his doctoral research at Columbia University, he ran a war game with military audiences to understand how drones impact escalation dynamics.&amp;nbsp;He &lt;a href="https://warontherocks.com/2019/01/game-of-drones-what-experimental-wargames-reveal-about-drones-and-escalation/" target="_blank"&gt;wrote in &lt;em&gt;War on the Rocks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “The experimental wargames revealed that the deployment of drones can actually contribute to lower levels of escalation and greater crisis stability than the deployment of manned assets.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At MIT, Lin-Greenberg, Samuels, and Heginbotham co-convene the Wargaming Working Group, mentor PhD students working on war-gaming research, and continue to advance the field of war-gaming methodology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With co-authors Pauly and Jacquelyn Schneider, Lin-Greenberg published “&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/13540661211064090?journalCode=ejta"&gt;Wargaming for International Relations Research&lt;/a&gt;” in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;European Journal of International Relations&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;in December 2021. The article establishes a research agenda for war gaming and highlights some of the methodological challenges of using war games.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors “explain how researchers can navigate issues of recruitment, bias, validity, and generalizability when using war games for research, and identify ways to evaluate the potential benefits and pitfalls of war games as a tool of inquiry.” One of these benefits, according to the authors, is the ability of war gaming to provide new data and help answer&amp;nbsp;challenges and questions&amp;nbsp;about human behavior and decision-making.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Heginbotham, there is something unique about designing and participating in war games where decision-making under pressure leads to learning. “The data you uncover in the process of designing a game and the lessons you internalize while playing the game, would be very difficult to create in any other setting,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Samuels is optimistic about the role of war gaming moving forward. He explains that the future of war gaming is bright so long as organizations — political, educational, industrial, military, and civic — continue to recognize the need to train future leaders in decision-making. Samuels is fond of quoting the Nobel laureate Thomas Schelling, a pioneer of civil-military war gaming while at Rand in the late 1950s and a partner of Lincoln Bloomfield at CIS, who once wrote: “Games won’t play music or cook fish, cure a man of stuttering, or improve my children’s French, just as they may not predict Pearl Harbor. But unless [critics] can show that games would have accentuated the tendency to ignore Pearl Harbor … [they] might have taught us something else useful.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Understanding the war in Ukraine</title>

  <description><![CDATA[At a recent seminar, MIT faculty analyzed Russia's invasion of Ukraine.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Christopher Burns | Security Studies Program</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT’s Security Studies Program (SSP) presented a special seminar on March 2 entitled, "Understanding the War in Ukraine." Over 100 alumni and affiliates in far-flung locations tuned in to hear the seminar during a livestream presentation, which featured commentary by four experts in this realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants in the discussion included two MIT professors of political science: &lt;a href="https://polisci.mit.edu/people/mariya-grinberg"&gt;Mariya Grinberg&lt;/a&gt;, whose work focuses on conflict economics, and &lt;a href="https://polisci.mit.edu/people/barry-r-posen"&gt;Barry Posen&lt;/a&gt;, whose specialties include military doctrine and grand strategy. They were joined by &lt;a href="Carol Saivetz"&gt;Carol Saivetz&lt;/a&gt;, a Russia expert and special adviser to MIT SSP, and &lt;a href="https://history.mit.edu/people/elizabeth-wood/"&gt;Elizabeth A. Wood&lt;/a&gt;, a Russia specialist and professor of history at MIT. Professor&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://polisci.mit.edu/people/m-taylor-fravel" target="_blank"&gt;M. Taylor Fravel&lt;/a&gt; moderated the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wood began the seminar by offering her opinion on Russian president Vladimir Putin’s motivations for invading Ukraine. Referencing public addresses the Russian autocrat has given in recent weeks, Wood said “Clearly, he's expressing a great deal of emotion — I would call it rage — at Ukraine for daring to go an independent route.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She clarified to note that independence, for Putin, is not so much about democracy, “as it is about economics.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He wanted Ukraine to be the jewel in his Eurasian Union,” she said. “[In] 2014, it became clear that they were not going to be [that] jewel.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Wood, Saivetz initially focused on Russia’s inability to exercise influence in “rule-setting” during the twilight of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Russia was not part of the rule-setting” after the Soviet Union collapsed, she said. “It's not just about NATO expansion.” She added that after 1991, Russian government officials had rules and regulations imposed on them unilaterally. “Russia didn't set those rules. Russia wasn't consulted in that process,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Posen, the Ford International Professor of Political Science, began his opening presentation by noting the fog of war continued to obscure any expert analysis of the situation on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said he believed both the Ukrainian and Russian governments were capably “managing” information flowing out of the country. Any expert outside of Ukraine “was reading tea leaves” in coming to conclusions, he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Even the press has a problem,” Posen said. “If you look at the various key press outlets, if you look at their war situation maps, that all comes from the same place. There is no independent judgment by these journalists.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grinberg, an expert in conflict economics, described the various sanctions aimed at Russia by Western allies, including: “smart sanctions,” which are things like travel bans directed at individual actors; commercial sanctions, which ban the export of certain products to a country; and financial sanctions, which impact a country’s ability to raise capital and use currency that it has in store in foreign banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seminar was live-streamed to an audience of Department of Political Science faculty, students, and alumni.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In its first days, Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine in late February has been met with substantial resistance. It has also created civilian casualties, a refugee crisis, a global movement to sanction Russia, and intense concern among observers around the world. &lt;/em&gt;MIT News&lt;em&gt; asked Elizabeth Wood, professor of history at MIT and author of the 2016 book “Roots of Russia’s War in Ukraine” (published by the Woodrow Wilson Center and Columbia University Press), to evaluate the situation, as of the beginning of March, slightly less than a week after the invasion began.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What is your overall assessment of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine right now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; At this scary moment, with the military conflict in Ukraine changing by the hour, it looks like the Kremlin could win the war but lose the battle for hearts and minds. In war one of the greatest dangers is overconfidence. We ourselves must be careful not to underestimate the Kremlin’s and the Russian military’s ability to dig in their heels and hold out for a long time in Ukraine. This could be a very long, very bloody siege war. At the same time, however, it seems clear that Putin and his small entourage of trusted advisors may have badly miscalculated.&amp;nbsp; Their overconfidence in their own narrative may have blinded them to the realities not only on the ground but also in the entire surrounding region.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Specifically, what are the miscalculations Putin seems to have made?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; They can be seen in at least three principal areas: in his underestimation of the Ukrainians themselves, in his overestimation of his own playbook, and in his failure to recognize the degree to which other countries and their leaders feel solidarity with the Ukrainians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What is the nature of his miscalculation regarding the Ukrainian people?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Most of what Putin has said recently about Ukraine and Ukrainians was intended to motivate a war he had already decided on. And most of it is too odious to warrant repetition; it should be consigned to Trotsky’s famous dustbin of history. At the core of all Putin’s comments is an idea that is widespread among Russians and repugnant to Ukrainians, namely that Ukraine is “little Russia” and Ukrainians are “little Russians.” Putin has said explicitly that he believes Ukrainians and Russians are “one people” who belong in one state. For him, this is justification for the war. But it is also based on an assumption that the Ukrainians are not capable of effectively and efficiently running their government and deciding their own affairs, including military ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What is the “playbook” Putin is using, and how are events unfolding differently than he expected?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Putin has used a particular playbook for taking foreign territories quite successfully now for over 20 years: Hit hard and fast with massive force; try for as few civilian casualties as possible; emerge as bloodless and triumphant as possible. He first tried this in Chechnya starting as soon as he was named acting Prime Minister in August 1999, bombing Grozny, the capital city, in October of that year and causing massive civilian deaths, but denying that the Russian intervention was a “war.” Journalists who covered it were killed outright, kidnapped, jailed, and/or banned from publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He tried it again in the five-day Georgian War of 2008 when Russian forces were positioned north of the Caucasus Mountains waiting for the slightest provocation from the Georgians in South Ossetia, their northernmost province. In that case they were able to seize South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and both of those republics were declared “independent,” but their residents were granted Russian passports and encouraged to consider themselves citizens of Russia. And he tried it in Crimea, first positioning his own people in the Crimean Parliament and as mayor of Sevastopol’ by &lt;em&gt;coup d’etat&lt;/em&gt;, having those leaders ask for Russia’s “help,” declaring Crimea “independent,” and holding a referendum (with Kalashnikovs in every polling place) on Crimea “joining” the Russian Federation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2021-2022, Ukraine presented a challenge, however, probably because of its sheer size. The Russians built up on three and a half sides of Ukraine for almost 11 months before they began the military invasion. The Russian playbook has also relied on divisions within the country they are attacking. This worked in Transnistria, Georgia, Crimea, and in the initial phases of the Donbas takeover. Unfortunately for them, there has been little division between “Russians” and “Ukrainians” in Ukraine. One point Ukrainian scholars have been making repeatedly is that “Ukrainian” has become a &lt;em&gt;civic&lt;/em&gt; nationality, more than one of language, religion, or even political identification. Someone can be Ukrainian and speak Russian; they can go to the Russian Orthodox Church or Moscow Patriarchate; they can disagree vehemently about Ukrainian politics. But they agree on their nationhood. Putin has succeeded in uniting Ukrainians in a way that Ukrainians themselves sometimes seem surprised to see.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, how has Putin underestimated the response of so many other countries in the world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Putin seems to have miscalculated that he could hit Ukraine now without serious resistance from the U.S. and Europe. That turned out to be a chimera. Political theater has always been at the core of Putin’s style of rule. His advisers’ reading of Biden was no doubt based on Biden’s public appearances and speeches to the American people, [and assumed] Biden looked weak because of his explicit commitment to building coalitions, trying to make peace among American domestic foes. In the Kremlin’s macho-based view, a peacemaker is by definition weak. What they completely underestimated is the U.S. President’s ability to reach out to world leaders and build some of the ties that the previous president had tried to rip up. The unity that has emerged against Russia is also a sign of the hunger of those world leaders to still work with the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key factor in the unity has been the degree to which leaders at the edges of Russia (Turkey, Finland, Poland, Czechia, Hungary) have taken up support for Ukraine. They have not sat on the sidelines as the Russian leadership no doubt calculated they would. Here Putin’s practices of bullying other leaders may be coming home to roost. He bullied Recep Tayyip Erdogan in 2015-16 for an entire year before finally admitting Turkey back into the fold. He has bullied the Finns for years, to the extent that now they say they wouldn’t wish Finlandization, i.e., living quietly in the shadow of Russia, on their worst enemies. The Central European countries have the most to lose in opposing Putin — they could be next in line.&amp;nbsp; But they have opened their doors to refugees; they have agreed in the decision to eject Russia from [the banking network] SWIFT, a decision that had to be taken unanimously by the 27 E.U. countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leader whom Putin has most underestimated has been Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Often derided as a “TV comedian” who couldn’t possibly know how to lead a country in a major conflict, Zelenskyy has instead shown himself to be an astute, charismatic leader who has been speaking to his people twice a day, rallying them, engaging them, and showing his own fearlessness. Many have criticized him for his allegedly slow response in the build-up of the crisis when he kept urging calm, urging the world not to overreact. But in fact, the Ukrainian military was clearly preparing to rebuff the Russian incursion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to media reports, one group for whom Putin’s propaganda does seem to be working is a significant portion of Russians themselves. His control over the internal television media is now so complete that they are not even &lt;a href="https://thebulletin.org/2022/03/letter-from-st-petersburg-many-russians-dont-even-kn%5b…%5dIwAR37mMeh1E5TYal3bWd5uee6AcqOLaeVvAfaaymYZ0HPDVFJ-_tC_qDko9U"&gt;seeing the war&lt;/a&gt;. All media outlets are forbidden from calling the military incursion a “war,” and the authorities are blocking ever more independent media that operate on the Internet, especially the TV station “Rain” and the program “Echo of Moscow.” The “Fortress Russia” mentality that Putin has been building up for the last 10 years is working effectively, so that many (though definitely not all) Russians easily believe the official line that Russia is forced to respond to alleged NATO buildups in Ukraine and “Nazis” who have taken over the Ukrainian government. Harsh penalties for criticizing the war have been introduced, making it “treason” which is punishable by up to 20 years in prison. This makes it unlikely that widespread protests will have much effect on the Kremlin’s decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a 40-mile convoy bearing down on Kyiv, it is entirely possible that Russia will crush Ukraine, destroy the land they wanted to annex, and shed massive numbers of Ukrainian lives. They won’t be able to claim the bloodlessness of their supposed victories in Georgia and Crimea. They may be able to suborn and oppress the Belarusian and Russian people as well, through sheer terror tactics. But it seems unlikely that they will be forgiven or understood or respected in the process. Respect has always been what these Russian leaders most want — to be respected on the world stage.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, this war has completely undermined any hope of them attaining that respect.&lt;/p&gt;
