  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For the fifth time in the history of the annual&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://maa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2024-Putnam-Competition-Announcement-of-Winners-1.pdf"&gt;William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition&lt;/a&gt;, and for the fifth year in a row, MIT swept all five of the contest’s top spots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The top five scorers each year are named Putnam Fellows.&amp;nbsp;Senior Brian Liu and juniors Papon Lapate and Luke Robitaille are now three-time Putnam Fellows, sophomore Jiangqi Dai earned his second win, and first-year Qiao Sun earned his first. Each receives a $2,500 award. This is also the fifth time that any school has had all five Putnam Fellows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;MIT’s team also came in first. The team was made up of Lapate, Robitaille, and Sun (in alphabetical order); Lapate and Robitaille were also on last year’s winning team. This is&amp;nbsp;MIT’s ninth first-place win in the past 11 competitions. Teams consist of the three top scorers from each institution. The institution with the first-place team receives a $25,000 award, and each team member receives $1,000.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;First-year Jessica Wan was the top-scoring woman, finishing in the top 25, which earned her the $1,000 Elizabeth Lowell Putnam Prize. She is the eighth MIT student to receive this honor since the award was created in 1992. This is the sixth year in a row that an MIT woman has won the prize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In total, 69 MIT students scored within the top 100. Beyond the top five scorers, MIT took nine of the next 11 spots (each receiving a $1,000 award), and seven of the next nine spots (earning $250 awards). Of the 75 receiving honorable mentions, 48 were from MIT. A total of 3,988 students took the exam in December, including 222 MIT students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This exam is considered to be the most prestigious university-level mathematics competition in the United States and Canada.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Putnam is known for its difficulty: While a perfect score is 120, this year’s top score was 90, and the median was just 2.&amp;nbsp;While many MIT students scored well, the Department of Mathematics is proud of everyone who just took the exam, says&amp;nbsp;Professor &lt;a href="https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=84"&gt;Michel Goemans&lt;/a&gt;, head of the Department of Mathematics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Year after year, I am so impressed by the sheer number of students at MIT that participate in the Putnam competition,” Goemans says.&amp;nbsp;“In no other college or university in the world can one find hundreds of students who get a kick out of thinking about math problems. So refreshing!”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Adds Professor&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=213"&gt;Bjorn Poonen&lt;/a&gt;, who helped MIT students prepare for the exam this year, “The incredible competition performance is just one manifestation of MIT’s vibrant community of students who love doing math and discussing math with each other, students who through their hard work in this environment excel in ways beyond competitions, too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;While the annual Putnam Competition is administered to thousands of undergraduate mathematics students across the United States and Canada, in recent years around 70 of its top 100 performers have been MIT students.&amp;nbsp;Since 2000, MIT has placed among the top five teams 23 times.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;MIT’s success in the Putnam exam isn’t surprising. MIT’s recent Putnam coaches are four-time Putnam Fellow Bjorn Poonen and&amp;nbsp;three-time Putnam Fellow&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=1354"&gt;Yufei Zhao&lt;/a&gt; ’10, PhD ’15.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;MIT is also a top destination for medalists participating in the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) for high school students. Indeed, over the last decade MIT has enrolled almost every American IMO medalist, and&amp;nbsp;more international IMO gold medalists&amp;nbsp;than&amp;nbsp;the universities of any other single country, according to forthcoming research from the&lt;a href="https://www.globtalent.org/activities/research"&gt; Global Talent Fund&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(GTF), which&amp;nbsp;offers scholarship and training programs for math Olympiad students and coaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;IMO participation is a strong predictor of future achievement. According to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://imof.co/news/results-highlights/"&gt;International Mathematics Olympiad Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, about half of Fields Medal winners are IMO alums — but it’s not the only ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Recruiting the most talented students is only the beginning. A top-tier university education — with excellent professors, supportive mentors, and an engaging peer community — is key to unlocking their full potential," says GTF President Ruchir Agarwal. "MIT’s sustained Putnam success shows how the right conditions deliver spectacular results. The catalytic reaction of MIT’s concentration of math talent and the nurturing environment of Building 2 should accelerate advancements in fundamental science for years and decades to come.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Many MIT mathletes see competitions not only as a way to hone their mathematical aptitude, but also as a way to create a strong sense of community, to help inspire and educate the next generation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/author/petey/"&gt;Chris Peterson&lt;/a&gt; SM ’13, director of communications and special projects at MIT Admissions and Student Financial Services, points out that many MIT students with competition math experience volunteer to help run programs for K-12 students including&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.hmmt.org/"&gt;HMMT&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mathprize.atfoundation.org/"&gt;Math Prize for Girls&lt;/a&gt;, and mentor research projects through&amp;nbsp;the Program for Research in Mathematics, Engineering and Science (&lt;a href="https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/index.html"&gt;PRIMES&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Many of the top scorers are also alumni of the&amp;nbsp;PRIMES high school outreach program. Two of this year’s Putnam Fellows, Liu and Robitaille, are PRIMES alumni, as are four of the next top 11, and six out of the next nine winners, along with many of the students receiving honorable mentions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=66"&gt;Pavel Etingof,&lt;/a&gt; a math professor who is also PRIMES’ chief research advisor, states that&amp;nbsp;among the 25 top winners, 12 (48 percent) are PRIMES alumni.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We at PRIMES are very proud of our alumnae’s fantastic showing at the Putnam Competition,” says&amp;nbsp;PRIMES director&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=1160"&gt;Slava Gerovitch&lt;/a&gt; PhD ’99. “PRIMES serves as a pipeline of mathematical excellence from high school through undergraduate studies, and beyond.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Along the same lines, a collaboration between the MIT Department of Mathematics and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://misti.mit.edu/mit-africa"&gt;MISTI-Africa&lt;/a&gt; has sent MIT students with Olympiad experience abroad during the Independent Activities Period (IAP) to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/it-all-adds-up-math-olympiad-mit-africa-0226"&gt;coach high school students who hope to compete for their national teams&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;First-years at MIT also take class&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://yufeizhao.com/a34/"&gt;18.A34&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;(Mathematical Problem Solving), known informally as the Putnam Seminar, not only to hone their Putnam exam skills, but also to make new friends.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Many people think of math competitions as primarily a way to identify and recognize talent, which of course they are,” says Peterson. “But the community convened by and through these competitions generates educational externalities that collectively exceed the sum of individual accomplishment.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Math Community and Outreach Officer&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=2614"&gt;Michael King&lt;/a&gt; also notes the camaraderie that forms around the test.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“My favorite time of the Putnam day is right after the problem session, when the students all jump up, run over to their friends, and begin talking animatedly,” says&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=2614"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt;, who also took the exam as an undergraduate student.&amp;nbsp;“They cheer each other’s successes, debate problem solutions, commiserate over missed answers, and share funny stories. It’s always amazing to work with the best math students in the world, but the most rewarding aspect is seeing the friendships that develop.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A full list of the winners can be found on the&lt;a href="https://maa.org/"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Putnam website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Seven MIT faculty and 21 additional MIT alumni are among 126 early-career researchers honored with &lt;a href="https://sloan.org/fellowships/2025-fellows"&gt;2025 Sloan Research Fellowships&lt;/a&gt; by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The recipients represent the MIT departments of&amp;nbsp;Biology; Chemical Engineering; Chemistry;&amp;nbsp;Civil and Environmental Engineering;&amp;nbsp;Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences; Economics;&amp;nbsp;Electrical Engineering and Computer Science;&amp;nbsp;Mathematics; and Physics as well as the Music and Theater Arts Section and the&amp;nbsp;MIT Sloan School of Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The fellowships honor exceptional researchers at U.S. and Canadian educational institutions, whose creativity, innovation, and research accomplishments make them stand out as the next generation of leaders. Winners receive a two-year, $75,000 fellowship that can be used flexibly to advance the fellow’s research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The Sloan Research Fellows represent the very best of early-career science, embodying the creativity, ambition, and rigor that drive discovery forward,” says Adam F. Falk, president of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. “These extraordinary scholars are already making significant contributions, and we are confident they will shape the future of their fields in remarkable ways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Including this year’s recipients, a total of 333 MIT faculty have received Sloan Research Fellowships since the program’s inception in 1955. MIT and Northwestern University are tied for having the most faculty in the 2025 cohort of fellows, each with seven. The MIT recipients are:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cheme.mit.edu/profile/ariel-l-furst/"&gt;Ariel L. Furst&lt;/a&gt; is the Paul M. Cook Career Development Professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT. Her lab combines biological, chemical, and materials engineering to solve challenges in human health and environmental sustainability, with lab members developing technologies for implementation in low-resource settings to ensure equitable access to technology. Furst completed her PhD in the lab of Professor Jacqueline K. Barton at Caltech developing new cancer diagnostic strategies based on DNA charge transport. She was then an A.O. Beckman Postdoctoral Fellow in the lab of Professor Matthew Francis at the University of California at Berkeley, developing sensors to monitor environmental pollutants. She is the recipient of the NIH New Innovator Award, the NSF CAREER Award, and the Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Award. She is passionate about STEM outreach and increasing participation of underrepresented groups in engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/people/mohsen-ghaffari/"&gt;Mohsen Ghaffari&lt;/a&gt; SM ’13, PhD ’17 is an associate professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) as well as the&amp;nbsp;Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). His research explores the theory of distributed and parallel computation, and he has had influential work on a range of algorithmic problems, including generic derandomization methods for distributed computing and parallel computing (which resolved several decades-old open problems), improved distributed algorithms for graph problems, sublinear algorithms derived via distributed techniques, and algorithmic and impossibility results for massively parallel computation. His work has been recognized with best paper awards at the IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA), ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures (SPAA), the ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing (PODC), and the International Symposium on Distributed Computing (DISC), the European Research Council's Starting Grant, and a Google Faculty Research Award, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/people/marzyeh-ghassemi/"&gt;Marzyeh Ghassemi&lt;/a&gt; PhD ’17 is an associate professor within EECS and the&amp;nbsp;Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES). Ghassemi earned two bachelor’s degrees in computer science and electrical engineering from New Mexico State University as a Goldwater Scholar; her MS in biomedical engineering from Oxford University as a Marshall Scholar; and her PhD in computer science from MIT. Following stints as a visiting researcher with Alphabet’s Verily and an assistant professor at University of Toronto, Ghassemi joined EECS and IMES as an assistant professor in July 2021. (IMES is the home of the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology.) She is affiliated with the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS),&amp;nbsp;the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab,&amp;nbsp;the Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health, the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS), and CSAIL. Ghassemi’s research in the Healthy ML Group creates a rigorous quantitative framework in which to design, develop, and place&amp;nbsp;machine learning models in a way that is robust and useful, focusing on health settings. Her contributions range from socially-aware model construction to improving subgroup- and shift-robust learning methods to identifying important insights in model deployment scenarios that have implications in policy, health practice, and equity. Among other awards, Ghassemi has been named one of &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;’s 35 Innovators Under 35 and an AI2050 Fellow, as well as receiving the 2018 Seth J.

His research lies at the intersection of finance and macroeconomics, with a particular focus on understanding the causes and consequences of financial crises over the past 150 years. Verner’s recent work examines the drivers of bank runs and insolvency during banking crises, the role of debt booms in amplifying macroeconomic fluctuations, the effectiveness of debt relief policies during crises, and how financial crises impact political polarization and support for populist parties. Before joining MIT, he earned a PhD in economics from Princeton University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/christian-wolf"&gt;Christian Wolf&lt;/a&gt;, the Rudi Dornbusch Career Development Assistant Professor of Economics and a faculty research fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research, works in macroeconomics, monetary economics, and time series econometrics. His work focuses on the development and application of new empirical methods to address classic macroeconomic questions and to evaluate how robust the answers are to a range of common modeling assumptions. His research has provided path-breaking insights on monetary transmission mechanisms and fiscal policy. In a separate strand of work, Wolf has substantially deepened our understanding of the appropriate methods macroeconomists should use to estimate impulse response functions — how key economic variables respond to policy changes or unexpected shocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The following MIT alumni also received fellowships:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jason Altschuler SM ’18, PhD ’22&lt;br&gt;David Bau III PhD ’21&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Rene Boiteau PhD ’16&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Lynne Chantranupong PhD ’17&lt;br&gt;Lydia B.

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Should you grab your umbrella before you walk out the door? Checking the weather forecast beforehand will only be helpful if that forecast is accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spatial prediction problems, like weather forecasting or air pollution estimation, involve predicting the value of a variable in a new location based on known values at other locations. Scientists typically use tried-and-true validation methods to determine how much to trust these predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But MIT researchers have shown that these popular validation methods can fail quite badly for spatial prediction tasks. This might lead someone to believe that a forecast is accurate or that a new prediction method is effective, when in reality that is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers developed a technique to assess prediction-validation methods and used it to prove that two classical methods can be substantively wrong on spatial problems. They then determined why these methods can fail and created a new method designed to handle the types of data used for spatial predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments with real and simulated data, their new method provided more accurate validations than the two most common techniques. The researchers evaluated each method using realistic spatial problems, including predicting the wind speed at the Chicago O-Hare Airport and forecasting the air temperature at five U.S. metro locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their validation method could be applied to a range of problems, from helping climate scientists predict sea surface temperatures to aiding epidemiologists in estimating the effects of air pollution on certain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hopefully, this will lead to more reliable evaluations when people are coming up with new predictive methods and a better understanding of how well methods are performing,” says Tamara Broderick, an associate professor in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), a member of the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems and the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, and an affiliate of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broderick is joined on the &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03527" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; by lead author and MIT postdoc David R. Burt and EECS graduate student Yunyi Shen. The research will be presented at the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluating validations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broderick’s group has recently collaborated with oceanographers and atmospheric scientists to develop machine-learning prediction models that can be used for problems with a strong spatial component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through this work, they noticed that traditional validation methods can be inaccurate in spatial settings. These methods hold out a small amount of training data, called validation data, and use it to assess the accuracy of the predictor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find the root of the problem, they conducted a thorough analysis and determined that traditional methods make assumptions that are inappropriate for spatial data. Evaluation methods rely on assumptions about how validation data and the data one wants to predict, called test data, are related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional methods assume that validation data and test data are independent and identically distributed, which implies that the value of any data point does not depend on the other data points. But in a spatial application, this is often not the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, a scientist may be using validation data from EPA air pollution sensors to test the accuracy of a method that predicts air pollution in conservation areas. However, the EPA sensors are not independent — they were sited based on the location of other sensors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, perhaps the validation data are from EPA sensors near cities while the conservation sites are in rural areas. Because these data are from different locations, they likely have different statistical properties, so they are not identically distributed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our experiments showed that you get some really wrong answers in the spatial case when these assumptions made by the validation method break down,” Broderick says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers needed to come up with a new assumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specifically spatial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking specifically about a spatial context, where data are gathered from different locations, they designed a method that assumes validation data and test data vary smoothly in space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, air pollution levels are unlikely to change dramatically between two neighboring houses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This regularity assumption is appropriate for many spatial processes, and it allows us to create a way to evaluate spatial predictors in the spatial domain. To the best of our knowledge, no one has done a systematic theoretical evaluation of what went wrong to come up with a better approach,” says Broderick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To use their evaluation technique, one would input their predictor, the locations they want to predict, and their validation data, then it automatically does the rest. In the end, it estimates how accurate the predictor’s forecast will be for the location in question. However, effectively assessing their validation technique proved to be a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are not evaluating a method, instead we are evaluating an evaluation. So, we had to step back, think carefully, and get creative about the appropriate experiments we could use,” Broderick explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, they designed several tests using simulated data, which had unrealistic aspects but allowed them to carefully control key parameters. Then, they created more realistic, semi-simulated data by modifying real data. Finally, they used real data for several experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using three types of data from realistic problems, like predicting the price of a flat in England based on its location and forecasting wind speed, enabled them to conduct a comprehensive evaluation. In most experiments, their technique was more accurate than either traditional method they compared it to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, the researchers plan to apply these techniques to improve uncertainty quantification in spatial settings. They also want to find other areas where the regularity assumption could improve the performance of predictors, such as with time-series data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is funded, in part, by the National Science Foundation and the Office of Naval Research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As the capabilities of generative AI models have grown, you've probably seen how they can transform simple text prompts into hyperrealistic images and even extended video clips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, generative AI has shown potential in helping chemists and biologists explore static molecules, like proteins and DNA. Models like AlphaFold can predict molecular structures to accelerate drug discovery, and the MIT-assisted “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06415-8"&gt;RFdiffusion&lt;/a&gt;,” for example, can help design new proteins. One challenge, though, is that molecules are constantly moving and jiggling, which is important to model when constructing new proteins and drugs. Simulating these motions on a computer using physics — a technique known as molecular dynamics — can be very expensive, requiring billions of time steps on supercomputers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a step toward simulating these behaviors more efficiently, MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and Department of Mathematics researchers have developed a generative model that learns from prior data. The team’s system, called MDGen, can take a frame of a 3D molecule and simulate what will happen next like a video, connect separate stills, and even fill in missing frames. By hitting the “play button” on molecules, the tool could potentially help chemists design new molecules and closely study how well their drug prototypes for cancer and other diseases would interact with the molecular structure it intends to impact.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Co-lead author Bowen Jing SM ’22 says that MDGen is an early proof of concept, but it suggests the beginning of an exciting new research direction. “Early on, generative AI models produced somewhat simple videos, like a person blinking or a dog wagging its tail,” says Jing, a PhD student at CSAIL. “Fast forward a few years, and now we have amazing models like Sora or Veo that can be useful in all sorts of interesting ways. We hope to instill a similar vision for the molecular world, where dynamics trajectories are the videos. For example, you can give the model the first and 10th frame, and it’ll animate what’s in between, or it can remove noise from a molecular video and guess what was hidden.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers say that MDGen represents a paradigm shift from previous comparable works with generative AI in a way that enables much broader use cases. Previous approaches were “autoregressive,” meaning they relied on the previous still frame to build the next, starting from the very first frame to create a video sequence. In contrast, MDGen generates the frames in parallel with diffusion. This means MDGen can be used to, for example, connect frames at the endpoints, or “upsample” a low frame-rate trajectory in addition to pressing play on the initial frame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was presented in a paper shown at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) this past December. Last summer, it was awarded for its potential commercial impact at the International Conference on Machine Learning’s ML4LMS Workshop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some small steps forward for molecular dynamics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In experiments, Jing and his colleagues found that MDGen’s simulations were similar to running the physical simulations directly, while producing trajectories 10 to 100 times faster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The team first tested their model’s ability to take in a 3D frame of a molecule and generate the next 100 nanoseconds. Their system pieced together successive 10-nanosecond blocks for these generations to reach that duration. The team found that MDGen was able to compete with the accuracy of a baseline model, while completing the video generation process in roughly a minute — a mere fraction of the three hours that it took the baseline model to simulate the same dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When given the first and last frame of a one-nanosecond sequence, MDGen also modeled the steps in between. The researchers’ system demonstrated a degree of realism in over 100,000 different predictions: It simulated more likely molecular trajectories than its baselines on clips shorter than 100 nanoseconds. In these tests, MDGen also indicated an ability to generalize on peptides it hadn’t seen before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MDGen’s capabilities also include simulating frames within frames, “upsampling” the steps between each nanosecond to capture faster molecular phenomena more adequately. It can even ​​“inpaint” structures of molecules, restoring information about them that was removed. These features could eventually be used by researchers to design proteins based on a specification of how different parts of the molecule should move.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toying around with protein dynamics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jing and co-lead author Hannes Stärk say that MDGen is an early sign of progress toward generating molecular dynamics more efficiently. Still, they lack the data to make these models immediately impactful in designing drugs or molecules that induce the movements chemists will want to see in a target structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers aim to scale MDGen from modeling molecules to predicting how proteins will change over time. “Currently, we’re using toy systems,” says Stärk, also a PhD student at CSAIL. “To enhance MDGen’s predictive capabilities to model proteins, we’ll need to build on the current architecture and data available. We don’t have a YouTube-scale repository for those types of simulations yet, so we’re hoping to develop a separate machine-learning method that can speed up the data collection process for our model.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, MDGen presents an encouraging path forward in modeling molecular changes invisible to the naked eye. Chemists could also use these simulations to delve deeper into the behavior of medicine prototypes for diseases like cancer or tuberculosis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Machine learning methods that learn from physical simulation represent a burgeoning new frontier in AI for science,” says Bonnie Berger, MIT Simons Professor of Mathematics, CSAIL principal investigator, and senior author on the paper. “MDGen is a versatile, multipurpose modeling framework that connects these two domains, and we’re very excited to share our early models in this direction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sampling realistic transition paths between molecular states is a major challenge,” says fellow senior author Tommi Jaakkola, who is the MIT Thomas Siebel Professor of electrical engineering and computer science and the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, and a CSAIL principal investigator. “This early work shows how we might begin to address such challenges by shifting generative modeling to full simulation runs.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers across the field of bioinformatics have heralded this system for its ability to simulate molecular transformations. “MDGen models molecular dynamics simulations as a joint distribution of structural embeddings, capturing molecular movements between discrete time steps,” says Chalmers University of Technology associate professor Simon Olsson, who wasn’t involved in the research. “Leveraging a masked learning objective, MDGen enables innovative use cases such as transition path sampling, drawing analogies to inpainting trajectories connecting metastable phases.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers’ work on MDGen was supported, in part, by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the U.S. Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, the Machine Learning for Pharmaceutical Discovery and Synthesis Consortium,&amp;nbsp;the Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;By adapting artificial intelligence models known as large language models, researchers have made great progress in their ability to predict a protein’s structure from its sequence. However, this approach hasn’t been as successful for antibodies, in part because of the hypervariability seen in this type of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome that limitation, MIT researchers have developed a computational technique that allows large language models to predict antibody structures more accurately. Their work could enable researchers to sift through millions of possible antibodies to identify those that could be used to treat SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our method allows us to scale, whereas others do not, to the point where we can actually find a few needles in the haystack,” says Bonnie Berger, the Simons Professor of Mathematics, the head of the Computation and Biology group in MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), and one of the senior authors of the new study. “If we could help to stop drug companies from going into clinical trials with the wrong thing, it would really save a lot of money.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technique, which focuses on modeling the hypervariable regions of antibodies, also holds potential for analyzing entire antibody repertoires from individual people. This could be useful for studying the immune response of people who are super responders to diseases such as HIV, to help figure out why their antibodies fend off the virus so effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bryan Bryson, an associate professor of biological engineering at MIT and a member of the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, is also a senior author of the paper, which &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2418918121" target="_blank"&gt;appears this week in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Rohit Singh, a former CSAIL research scientist who is now an assistant professor of biostatistics and bioinformatics and cell biology at Duke University, and Chiho Im ’22 are the lead authors of the paper. Researchers from Sanofi and ETH Zurich also contributed to the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modeling hypervariability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proteins consist of long chains of amino acids, which can fold into an enormous number of possible structures. In recent years, predicting these structures has become much easier to do, using artificial intelligence programs such as AlphaFold. Many of these programs, such as ESMFold and OmegaFold, are based on large language models, which were originally developed to analyze vast amounts of text, allowing them to learn to predict the next word in a sequence. This same approach can work for protein sequences — by learning which protein structures are most likely to be formed from different patterns of amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this technique doesn’t always work on antibodies, especially on a segment of the antibody known as the hypervariable region. Antibodies usually have a Y-shaped structure, and these hypervariable regions are located in the tips of the Y, where they detect and bind to foreign proteins, also known as antigens. The bottom part of the Y provides structural support and helps antibodies to interact with immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypervariable regions vary in length but usually contain fewer than 40 amino acids. It has been estimated that the human immune system can produce up to 1 quintillion different antibodies by changing the sequence of these amino acids, helping to ensure that the body can respond to a huge variety of potential antigens. Those sequences aren’t evolutionarily constrained the same way that other protein sequences are, so it’s difficult for large language models to learn to predict their structures accurately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Part of the reason why language models can predict protein structure well is that evolution constrains these sequences in ways in which the model can decipher what those constraints would have meant,” Singh says. “It’s similar to learning the rules of grammar by looking at the context of words in a sentence, allowing you to figure out what it means.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To model those hypervariable regions, the researchers created two modules that build on existing protein language models. One of these modules was trained on hypervariable sequences from about 3,000 antibody structures found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), allowing it to learn which sequences tend to generate similar structures. The other module was trained on data that correlates about 3,700 antibody sequences to how strongly they bind three different antigens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting computational model, known as AbMap, can predict antibody structures and binding strength based on their amino acid sequences. To demonstrate the usefulness of this model, the researchers used it to predict antibody structures that would strongly neutralize the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers started with a set of antibodies that had been predicted to bind to this target, then generated millions of variants by changing the hypervariable regions. Their model was able to identify antibody structures that would be the most successful, much more accurately than traditional protein-structure models based on large language models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, the researchers took the additional step of clustering the antibodies into groups that had similar structures. They chose antibodies from each of these clusters to test experimentally, working with researchers at Sanofi. Those experiments found that 82 percent of these antibodies had better binding strength than the original antibodies that went into the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying a variety of good candidates early in the development process could help drug companies avoid spending a lot of money on testing candidates that end up failing later on, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They don’t want to put all their eggs in one basket,” Singh says. “They don’t want to say, I’m going to take this one antibody and take it through preclinical trials, and then it turns out to be toxic. They would rather have a set of good possibilities and move all of them through, so that they have some choices if one goes wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparing antibodies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this technique, researchers could also try to answer some longstanding questions about why different people respond to infection differently. For example, why do some people develop much more severe forms of Covid, and why do some people who are exposed to HIV never become infected?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have been trying to answer those questions by performing single-cell RNA sequencing of immune cells from individuals and comparing them — a process known as antibody repertoire analysis. Previous work has shown that antibody repertoires from two different people may overlap as little as 10 percent. However, sequencing doesn’t offer as comprehensive a picture of antibody performance as structural information, because two antibodies that have different sequences may have similar structures and functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new model can help to solve that problem by quickly generating structures for all of the antibodies found in an individual. In this study, the researchers showed that when structure is taken into account, there is much more overlap between individuals than the 10 percent seen in sequence comparisons. They now plan to further investigate how these structures may contribute to the body’s overall immune response against a particular pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is where a language model fits in very beautifully because it has the scalability of sequence-based analysis, but it approaches the accuracy of structure-based analysis,” Singh says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by Sanofi and the Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Senior Holden Mui appreciates the details in mathematics and music. A well-written orchestral piece and a well-designed competitive math problem both require a certain flair and a well-tuned sense of how to keep an audience’s interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“People want fresh, new, non-recycled approaches to math and music,” he says. Mui sees his role as a guide of sorts, someone who can take his ideas for a musical composition or a math problem and share them with audiences in an engaging way. His ideas must make the transition from his mind to the page in as precise a way as possible. Details matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A double major in math and music from Lisle, Illinois, Mui believes it’s important to invite people into a creative process that allows a kind of conversation to occur between a piece of music he writes and his audience, for example. Or a math problem and the people who try to solve it. “Part of math’s appeal is its ability to reveal deep truths that may be hidden in simple statements,” he argues, “while contemporary classical music should be available for enjoyment by as many people as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mui’s first experience at MIT was as a high school student in 2017. He visited as a member of a high school math competition team attending an event hosted and staged by MIT and Harvard University students. The following year, Mui met other students at math camps and began thinking seriously about what was next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I chose math as a major because it’s been a passion of mine since high school. My interest grew through competitions and I continued to develop it through research,” he says. “I chose MIT because it boasts one of&amp;nbsp;the most rigorous and accomplished mathematics departments in the country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mui is also a math problem writer for the Harvard-MIT Math Tournament (HMMT) and performs with Ribotones, a club that travels to places like retirement homes or public spaces on the Institute’s campus to play music for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mui studies piano with Timothy McFarland, an artist affiliate at MIT, through the &lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/music/performance/emersonharris-program-private-study" title="https://mta.mit.edu/music/performance/emersonharris-program-private-study" data-outlook-id="e79ca899-7b74-4503-b2a9-8eebed89f18c"&gt;MIT Emerson/Harris Fellowship Program&lt;/a&gt;, and previously studied with Kate Nir and Matthew Hagle of the Music Institute of Chicago. He started piano at the age of five and cites French composer Maurice Ravel as one of his major musical influences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As a music student at MIT, Mui is involved in piano performance, chamber music, collaborative piano, the MIT Symphony Orchestra as a violist, conducting, and composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;He enjoys the incredible variety available within MIT’s music program. “It offers everything from electronic music to world music studies,” he notes, “and has broadened my understanding and appreciation of music’s diversity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborating to create&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Throughout his academic career, Mui found himself among like-minded students like former Yale University undergraduate Andrew Wu. Together, Mui and Wu won an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures"&gt;Emergent Ventures&lt;/a&gt; grant. In this collaboration, Mui wrote the music Wu would play. Wu described his experience with one of Mui’s compositions,&amp;nbsp;“&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkAlRaZO_Zs"&gt;Poetry&lt;/a&gt;,” as “demanding serious focus and continued re-readings,” yielding nuances even after repeated listens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Another of Mui’s compositions,&amp;nbsp;“&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DM1US3yQ58g"&gt;Landscapes&lt;/a&gt;,” was performed by MIT’s Symphony Orchestra in October 2024 and offered audiences opportunities to engage with the ideas he explores in his music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One of the challenges Mui discovered early is that academic composers sometimes create music audiences might struggle to understand. “People often say that music is a universal language, but one of the most valuable insights I’ve gained at MIT is that music isn’t as universally experienced as one might think,” he says. “There are notable differences, for example, between Western music and world music.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This, Mui says, broadened his perspective on how to approach music and encouraged him to consider his audience more closely when composing. He treats music as an opportunity to invite people into how he thinks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creative ideas, accessible outcomes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mui understands the value of sharing his skills and ideas with others, crediting the MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives (MISTI) program with offering multiple opportunities for travel and teaching. “I’ve been on three MISTI trips during IAP [Independent Activities Period] to teach mathematics,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mui says it’s important to be flexible, dynamic, and adaptable in preparation for a fulfilling professional life. Music and math both demand the development of the kinds of soft skills that can help him succeed as a musician, composer, and mathematician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Creating math problems is surprisingly similar to writing music,” he argues. “In both cases, the work needs to be complex enough to be interesting without becoming unapproachable.” For Mui, designing original math problems is “like trying to write down an original melody.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“To write math problems, you have to have seen a lot of math problems before. To write music, you have to know the literature — Bach, Beethoven, Ravel, Ligeti — as diverse a group of personalities as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A future in the notes and numbers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mui points to the professional and personal virtues of exploring different fields. “It allows me to build a more diverse network of people with unique perspectives,” he says. “Professionally, having a range of experiences and viewpoints to draw on is invaluable; the broader my knowledge and network, the more insights I can gain to succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;After graduating, Mui plans to pursue doctoral study in mathematics following the completion of a cryptography internship. “The connections I’ve made at MIT, and will continue to make, are valuable because they’ll be useful regardless of the career I choose,” he says. He wants to continue researching math he finds challenging and rewarding. As with his music, he wants to strike a balance between&amp;nbsp;emotion and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I think it’s important not to pull all of one’s eggs in one basket,” he says. “One important figure that comes to mind is Isaac Newton, who split his time among three fields: physics, alchemy, and theology.” Mui’s path forward will inevitably include music and math. Whether crafting compositions or designing math problems, Mui seeks to invite others into a world where notes and numbers converge to create meaning, inspire connection, and transform understanding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Yiming Chen ’24, Wilhem Hector, Anushka Nair, and David Oluigbo&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;have been selected as 2025 Rhodes Scholars and will begin fully funded postgraduate studies at Oxford University in the U.K. next fall. In addition to MIT’s two U.S. Rhodes winners, Oluigbo and Nair, two affiliates were awarded international Rhodes Scholarships: Chen for Rhodes’ China constituency and Hector for the Global Rhodes Scholarship. Hector is the first Haitian citizen to be named a Rhodes Scholar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scholars were supported by Associate Dean Kim Benard and the Distinguished Fellowships team in Career Advising and Professional Development. They received additional mentorship and guidance from the Presidential Committee on Distinguished Fellowships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is profoundly inspiring to work with our amazing students, who have accomplished so much at MIT&amp;nbsp;and, at the same time, thought deeply about how they can have an impact in solving the world's major challenges,” says Professor Nancy Kanwisher, who co-chairs the committee along with Professor Tom Levenson. “These students have worked hard to develop and articulate their vision and to learn to communicate it to others with passion, clarity, and confidence. We are thrilled but not surprised to see so many of them recognized this year as finalists and as winners.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yiming Chen ’24&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yiming Chen, from Beijing, China, and the Washington area, was named one of four Rhodes China Scholars on Sept 28. At Oxford, she will pursue graduate studies in engineering science, working toward her ongoing goal of advancing AI safety and reliability in clinical workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chen graduated from MIT in 2024 with a BS in mathematics and computer science and an MEng in computer science. She worked on several projects involving machine learning for health care, and focused her master’s research on medical imaging in the Medical Vision Group of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collaborating with IBM Research, Chen developed a neural framework for clinical-grade lumen segmentation in intravascular ultrasound and presented her findings at the MICCAI Machine Learning in Medical Imaging conference. Additionally, she worked at Cleanlab, an MIT-founded startup, creating an open-source library to ensure the integrity of image datasets used in vision tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chen was a teaching assistant in the MIT math and electrical engineering and computer science departments, and received a teaching excellence award. She taught high school students at the Hampshire College Summer Studies in Math and was selected to participate in MISTI Global Teaching Labs in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having studied the guzheng, a traditional Chinese instrument, since age 4, Chen served as president of the MIT Chinese Music Ensemble, explored Eastern and Western music synergies with the MIT Chamber Music Society, and performed at the United Nations. On campus, she was also active with Asymptones a capella,&amp;nbsp;MIT Ring Committee, Ribotones, Figure Skating Club, and the Undergraduate Association Innovation Committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wilhem Hector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilhem Hector, a senior from Port-au-Prince, Haiti, majoring in mechanical engineering, was awarded a Global Rhodes Scholarship on Nov 1. The first Haitian national to be named a Rhodes Scholar, Hector will pursue at Oxford a master’s in energy systems followed by a master’s in education, focusing on digital and social change. His long-term goals are twofold: pioneering Haiti’s renewable energy infrastructure and expanding hands-on opportunities in the country‘s national curriculum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hector developed his passion for energy through his research in the MIT Howland Lab, where he investigated the uncertainty of wind power production during active yaw control. He also helped launch the MIT Renewable Energy Clinic through his work on the sources of opposition to energy projects in the U.S. Beyond his research, Hector had notable contributions as an intern at Radia Inc. and DTU Wind Energy Systems, where he helped develop computational wind farm modeling and simulation techniques.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Outside of MIT, he leads the Hector Foundation, a nonprofit providing educational opportunities to young people in Haiti. He has raised over $80,000 in the past five years to finance their initiatives, including the construction of Project Manus, Haiti’s first open-use engineering makerspace. Hector’s service endeavors have been supported by the MIT PKG Center, which awarded him the Davis Peace Prize, the PKG Fellowship for Social Impact, and the PKG Award for Public Service.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hector co-chairs both the Student Events Board and the Class of 2025 Senior Ball Committee and has served as the social chair for Chocolate City and the African Students Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anushka Nair&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anushka Nair, from Portland, Oregon, will graduate next spring with BS and MEng degrees in computer science and engineering with concentrations in economics and AI. She plans to pursue a DPhil in social data science at the Oxford Internet Institute. Nair aims to develop ethical AI technologies that address pressing societal challenges, beginning with combating misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For her master’s thesis under Professor David Rand, Nair is developing LLM-powered fact-checking tools to detect nuanced misinformation beyond human or automated capabilities.

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;After 274 young women spent two-and-a-half hours working through 20 advanced math problems for the 16th annual&amp;nbsp;Advantage Testing Foundation/Jane Street &lt;a href="https://mathprize.atfoundation.org/"&gt;Math Prize for Girls&lt;/a&gt; (MP4G) contest held Oct. 4-6 at MIT, a six-way tie was announced.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Hosted by the MIT Department of Mathematics and sponsored by the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.atfoundation.org/"&gt;Advantage Testing Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and global trading firm&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.janestreet.com/"&gt;Jane Street&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;MP4G is the largest math prize for girls in the world. The competitors, who came from across the United States and Canada, had scored high enough on the American Mathematics Competition exam to apply for and be accepted by MP4G. This year, MP4G received 891 applications to solve multistage problems in geometry, algebra, and trigonometry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mathprize.atfoundation.org/resources"&gt;This year's problems&lt;/a&gt; are listed on the MP4G website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Because of the six-way tie, the $50,000 first-place prize and subsequent awards ($20,000 for second, $10,000 for third, $4,000 apiece for fourth and fifth and $2,000 for sixth place) was instead evenly divided, with each winner receiving $15,000. While each scored 15 out of 20, the winners were actually placed in order of how they answered the most difficult problems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In first place was Shruti Arun, 11th grade, Cherry Creek High School, Colorado, who last year placed fourth; followed by Angela Liu, 12th grade, home-schooled, California; Sophia Hou, 11th grade, Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Virginia; Susie Lu, 11th grade, Stanford Online High School, Washington, who last year placed 19th; Katie He, 12th grade, the Frazer School, Florida;&amp;nbsp;and Katherine Liu, 12th grade, Clements High School, Texas — with the latter two having tied for seventh place last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The next round of winners, all with a score of 14, took home $1,000 each: Angela Ho, 11th grade, Stevenson High School, Illinois; Hannah Fox, 12th grade, Proof School, California; Selena Ge, 9th grade, Lexington High School, Massachusetts; Alansha Jiang, 12th grade, Newport High School, Washington; Laura Wang, 9th grade, Lakeside School, Washington; Alyssa Chu, 12th grade, Rye Country Day School, New York; Emily Yu, 12th grade, Mendon High School, New York; and Ivy Guo, 12th grade, Blair High School, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The $2,000 Youth Prize to the highest-scoring contestant in 9th grade or below was shared evenly by Selena Ge and Laura Wang. In total, the event awards $100,000 in monetary prize&amp;nbsp;to the top 14 contestants (including tie scores). Honorable mention trophies were awarded to the next 25 winners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I knew there were a lot of really smart people there, so the chances of me getting first wasn’t particularly high,” Katie He &lt;a href="https://www.mainstreetdailynews.com/education/local-student-first-mit-competition"&gt;told a Florida newspaper&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;“When I heard six ways, I was so excited though,” He says, “because that’s just really cool that we all get to be happy about our performances and celebrate together and share the same joy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The event featured a&amp;nbsp;keynote lecture by Harvard University professor of mathematics&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_Williams_(mathematician)"&gt;Lauren Williams&lt;/a&gt; on the "Combinatorics of Hopping Particles;” talks by&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.poshenloh.com/"&gt;Po-Shen Loh&lt;/a&gt;, professor of math at Carnegie Mellon University, and&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Klawe"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Maria Klawe&lt;/a&gt;, president of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.mathforamerica.org/"&gt;Math for America&lt;/a&gt;; and a musical performance by the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://logarhythms.squarespace.com/"&gt;MIT Logarhythms&lt;/a&gt;. Last year’s winner, Jessica Wan, volunteered as a proctor.&amp;nbsp;Now a first-year at MIT, Wan won MP4G in 2022 and 2019.&amp;nbsp;Alumna and doctoral candidate&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=2315"&gt;Nitya Mani&lt;/a&gt; was on hand to note, during her speech at the awards ceremony, how much bigger the event has grown over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The day before the competition, attendees gathered to attend campus tours, icebreaker events, and networking sessions around MIT, at the Boston Marriott Cambridge, and at Kresge Auditorium, where the awards ceremony took place. Contestants also met MP4G alumnae at the Women in STEM Ask Me Anything event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Math Community and Outreach Officer Michael King described the event as a “virtuous circle” where alumni return to encourage participants and help to keep the event running. “It’s good for MIT, because it attracts top female students from around the country. The atmosphere, with hundreds of girls excited about math and supported by their families, was wonderful. I thought to myself, ‘This is possible, to have rooms of math people that aren’t 80 percent men.’ The more women in math, the more role models. This is what inspires people to enter a discipline. MP4G creates a community of role models.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Chris Peterson SM ’13, director of communications and special projects at MIT Admissions and Student Financial Services, agrees. “Everyone sees and appreciates the competitive function that Math Prize performs to identify and celebrate these highly talented young mathematicians. What’s less visible, but equally or even more important, is the crucial community role it plays as an affinity community to build&amp;nbsp; relationships and a sense of belonging among these young women that will follow and empower them through the rest of their education and careers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Petersen also discussed life at MIT and the admissions process at the Art of Problem Solving’s recent&lt;a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/school/mathjams"&gt;&amp;nbsp;free MIT Math Jam&lt;/a&gt;, as he has annually for the past decade. He was joined by MIT Math doctoral candidate Evan Chen ’18, a former deputy leader of the USA International Math Olympiad team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Many alumnae returned to MIT to participate in a panel for attendees and their parents. For one panelist, MP4G is a family affair. Sheela Devadas, MP4G ’10 and ’11, is the sister of electrical engineering and computer science doctoral candidate and fellow MP4G alum&lt;a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/lalita-devadas"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Lalita&lt;/a&gt;; their mother, Sulochana, is MP4G’s program administrator.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“One of the goals of MP4G is to inspire young mathematicians,” says Devadas. “Although it is a competition, there is a lot of camaraderie between the contestants as well, and opportunities to meet both current undergraduate STEM majors and older role models who have pursued math-based careers. This aligned with my experience at MIT as a math major, where the atmosphere felt both competitive and collaborative in a way that inspired us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“There are many structural barriers and interpersonal issues facing women in STEM-oriented careers,” she adds. “One issue that is sometimes overlooked, which I have sometimes run into, is that both in school and in the workplace, it can be challenging to get your peers to respect your mathematical skill rather than pressuring you to take on tasks like note-taking or scheduling that are seen as more 'female' (though those tasks are also valuable and necessary).”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Another panelist, Jennifer Xiong ’23, talked about her time at MP4G, MIT, and her current role as a pharmaceutical researcher at Moderna.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“MP4G is what made me want to attend MIT, where I met my first MIT friend,” she says.&amp;nbsp;Later, as an MIT student, she volunteered with MP4G to help her stay connected with the program. “MP4G is exciting because it brings together young girls who are interested in solving hard problems, to MIT campus, where they can build community and foster their interests in math.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Volunteer Ranu Boppana ’87, the wife of MP4G founding director and MIT Math Research Affiliate&lt;a href="https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=1659"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Ravi Boppana&lt;/a&gt; PhD ’86, appreciates watching how this program has helped inspire women to pursue STEM education. “I’m most struck by the fact that MIT is now gender-balanced for undergraduates, but also impressed with what a more diverse place it is in every way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Boppanas were inspired to found MP4G because their daughter was a mathlete in middle school and high school, and often the only girl in many regional competitions.&amp;nbsp;“Ravi realized that the girls needed a community of their own, and role models to help them visualize seeing themselves in STEM.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Each year, the best part of MP4G is seeing the girls create wonderful networks for themselves, as some are often the only girls they know interested in math at home.&amp;nbsp;This event is also such a fabulous introduction to MIT for them. I think this event helps MIT recruit the most mathematically talented girls in the country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Ravi also recently created the YouTube channel&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN9CBC4dh9tdAgAKCQOzrXg"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Boppana Math&lt;/a&gt;, geared toward high school students.&amp;nbsp;“My goal is to create videos that are accessible to bright high school students, such as the participants in the Math Prize for Girls,” says Ravi. “My most recent video,&lt;a href="https://some.3b1b.co/"&gt;&amp;nbsp;'Hypergraphs and Acute Triangles,'&lt;/a&gt; won an Honorable Mention at this year’s Summer of Math Exposition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c132h3416350_math_prize_2024_award_winners"&gt;full list of winners&lt;/a&gt; is posted on the Art of Problem Solving website.&amp;nbsp;The top 45 students are invited to take the 2024 Math Prize for Girls Olympiad at their schools. Canada/USA Mathcamp also provides $500 merit scholarships to the top 35 MP4G&amp;nbsp;students who enroll in its summer program. This reflects a $250 increase to the scholarships. &lt;a href="https://mathprize.atfoundation.org/apply/application"&gt;Applications&lt;/a&gt; to compete in next year’s MP4G will open in March 2025.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Researchers at MIT recently signed a four-year collaboration agreement with the Novo Nordisk Foundation Quantum Computing Programme (NQCP) at Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen (UCPH), focused on accelerating quantum computing hardware research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement means that both universities will set up identical quantum laboratories at their respective campuses in Copenhagen and Cambridge, Massachusetts, facilitating seamless cooperation as well as shared knowledge and student exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To realize the promise of quantum computing, we must learn how to build systems that are robust, reproducible, and extensible. This unique program enables us to innovate faster by exchanging personnel and ideas, running parallel experiments, and comparing results. Even better, we get to continue working with Professor Morten Kjaergaard, a rising star in the field, and his team in Copenhagen,” says William Oliver, the Henry Ellis Warren (1894) Professor within the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), professor of physics, associate director of the Research Laboratory of Electronics, and the head of the Center for Quantum Engineering at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oliver’s team will supervise the funded research, which will focus specifically on the development of fault-tolerant quantum computing hardware and quantum algorithms that solve life-science relevant chemical and biological problems. The agreement provides 18 million Danish kroner (approximately $2.55 million) from the Novo Nordisk Foundation Quantum Computing Program to support MIT’s part in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A forefront objective in quantum computing is the development of state-of-the-art hardware with consistent operation,” says Maria Zuber, MIT’s presidential advisor for science and technology policy, who helped facilitate the relationship between MIT and the Danish university. “The goal of this collaboration is to demonstrate this system behavior, which will be an important step in the path to practical application.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fostering collaborations between MIT and other universities is truly essential as we look to accelerate the pace of discovery and research in fast-growing fields such as quantum computing,” adds Anantha Chandrakasan, chief innovation and strategy officer, dean of engineering, and the Vannevar Bush Professor of EECS. “The support from the Novo Nordisk Foundation Quantum Computing Programme will ensure the world’s leading experts can focus on advancing research and developing solutions that have real-world impact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is an important recognition of our work at UCPH and NQCP. Professor Oliver’s team at MIT is part of the international top echelon of quantum computing research,” says Morten Kjaergaard, associate professor of quantum information physics and research group leader at the Niels Bohr Institute at UCPH. “This project enables Danish research in quantum computing hardware to learn from the best as we collaborate on developing hardware for next-generation fault-tolerant quantum computing. I have previously had the pleasure of working closely with Professor Oliver, and with this ambitious collaboration as part of our the Novo Nordisk Foundation Quantum Computing Programme, we are able to push our joint research to a new level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Krogstrup, CEO of NQCP and professor at Niels Bohr Institute, follows up, “We are excited to work with Will Oliver and his innovative team at MIT. It aligns very well with our strategic focus on identifying a path with potential to enable quantum computing for life sciences. The support aims to strengthen the already strong collaboration between Will and Morten’s team, a collaboration we hope to make an important part of the NQCP pathfinder phase over the coming years.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;What does your license plate say about you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, more than 9 million vehicles carry personalized “vanity” license plates, in which preferred words, digits, or phrases replace an otherwise random assignment of letters and numbers to identify a vehicle. While each state and the District of Columbia maintains its own rules about appropriate selections, creativity reigns when choosing a unique vanity plate. What’s more, the stories behind them can be just as fascinating as the people who use them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might not come as a surprise to learn that quite a few MIT community members have participated in such vehicular whimsy. Read on to meet some of them and learn about the nerdy, artsy, techy, and MIT-related plates that color their rides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A little piece of tech heaven&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most recognized vehicles around campus is Samuel Klein’s 1998 Honda Civic. More than just the holder of a vanity plate, it’s an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_car" target="_blank"&gt;art car&lt;/a&gt; —&amp;nbsp;a vehicle that’s been custom-designed as a way to express an artistic idea or theme. Klein’s Civic is covered with hundreds of 5.5-inch floppy disks in various colors, and it sports disks, computer keys, and other techy paraphernalia on the interior. With its double-entendre vanity plate, “DSKDRV” (“disk drive”), the art car initially came into being on the West Coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Klein, a longtime affiliate of the MIT Media Lab, MIT Press, and MIT Libraries, first heard about the car from fellow Wikimedian and current MIT librarian Phoebe Ayers. An artistic friend of Ayers’, Lara Wiegand, had&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2007/09/18/diskdrv-doesnt-like-magnets/" target="_blank"&gt;designed and decorated the car&lt;/a&gt; in Seattle but wanted to find a new owner. Klein was intrigued and decided to fly west to check the Civic out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I went out there, spent a whole afternoon seeing how she maintained the car and talking about engineering and mechanisms and the logistics of what’s good and bad,” Klein says. “It had already gone through many iterations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Klein quickly decided he was up to the task of becoming the new owner. As he drove the car home across the country, it “got a wide range of really cool responses across different parts of the U.S.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in Massachusetts, Klein made a few adjustments: “We painted the hubcaps, we added racing stripes, we added a new generation of laser-etched glass circuits and, you know, I had my own collection of antiquated technology disks that seemed to fit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vanity plate also required a makeover. In Washington state it was “DISKDRV,” but, Klein says, “we had to shave the license plate a bit because there are fewer letters in Massachusetts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the car has about 250,000 miles and an &lt;a href="https://instagram.com/_DSKDRV_" target="_blank"&gt;Instagram account&lt;/a&gt;. “The biggest challenge is just the disks have to be resurfaced, like a lizard, every few years,” says Klein, whose partner, an MIT research scientist, often parks it around campus. “There’s a small collection of love letters for the car. People leave the car notes. It’s very sweet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marking his place in STEM history&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omar Abudayyeh ’12, PhD ’18, a recent McGovern Fellow at the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT who is now an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, shares an equally riveting story about his vanity plate, “CRISPR,” which adorns his sport utility vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plate refers to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/topic/crispr" target="_blank"&gt;the genome-editing technique&lt;/a&gt; that has revolutionized biological and medical research by enabling rapid changes to genetic material.&amp;nbsp;As an MIT graduate student in the lab of Professor Feng Zhang, a pioneering contributor to CRISPR technologies,&amp;nbsp;Abudayyeh was highly involved in early CRISPR development for DNA and RNA editing. In fact, he and Jonathan Gootenberg ’13, another recent McGovern Fellow and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School who works closely with&amp;nbsp;Abudayyeh,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/rna-targeting-enzyme-expands-crispr-toolkit-0920" target="_blank"&gt;discovered many novel CRISPR enzymes&lt;/a&gt;, such as Cas12 and Cas13, and applied these technologies for both gene therapy and CRISPR diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how did&amp;nbsp;Abudayyeh score his vanity plate? It was all due to his attendance at a genome-editing conference in 2022, where another early-stage CRISPR researcher, Samuel Sternberg, showed up in a car with New York “CRISPR” plates. “It became quite a source of discussion at the conference, and at one of the breaks, Sam and his labmates egged us on to get the Massachusetts license plate,” Abudayyeh explains. “I insisted that it must be taken, but I applied anyway, paying the 70 dollars and then receiving a message that I would get a letter eight to 12 weeks later about whether the plate was available or not. I then returned to Boston and forgot about it until a couple months later when, to my surprise, the plate arrived in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Abudayyeh continues his affiliation with the McGovern Institute, he and&amp;nbsp;Gootenberg recently set up a lab at Harvard Medical School as new faculty members. “We have continued to discover new enzymes, such as Cas7-11, that enable new frontiers, such as programmable proteases for RNA sensing and novel therapeutics, and we’ve applied CRISPR technologies for new efforts in gene editing and aging research,” Abudayyeh notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for his license plate, he says, “I’ve seen instances of people posting about it on Twitter or asking about it in Slack channels. A number of times, people have stopped me to say they read the Walter Isaacson book on CRISPR, asking how I was related to it. I would then explain my story — and describe how I’m actually in the book, in the chapters on CRISPR diagnostics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Displaying MIT roots, nerd pride&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some, a connection to MIT is all the reason they need to register a vanity plate — or three. Jeffrey Chambers SM ’06, PhD ’14, a graduate of the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, shares that he drives with a Virginia license plate touting his “PHD MIT.” Curtis Smith PhD ’02, professor of the practice in nuclear science and engineering, recently joined the MIT faculty after 33 years at the Idaho National Lab and keeps an “MITGRAD” plate on his convertible in Idaho Falls. Professor of biology Anthony Sinskey ScD ’67 owns several vehicles sporting vanity plates that honor Course 20, which is today the Department of Biological Engineering but has&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2006/facmtg-dec21" target="_blank"&gt;previously been known by&lt;/a&gt; Food Technology, Nutrition and Food Science, and Applied Biological Sciences. Sinskey says he has both “MIT 20” and “MIT XX” plates in Massachusetts and New Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopher Knittel, the George P. Shultz Professor of Applied Economics in the MIT Sloan School of Management, drives with a “TAXCO 2” plate in Massachusetts. (He notes it was supposed to be “TAX CO2” but the space was inadvertently misplaced by the RMV.) “The license plate is meant to represent a critical policy tool for addressing climate change: placing a tax on carbon dioxide emissions,” he says. Such a tax, he argues, “is the most efficient way to address the 'negative externalities' associated with climate change. ... A large portion of my research focuses on understanding the costs and consequences of different environmental policies, so the plate links to my work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several alumni also report driving with plates that reflect their STEM backgrounds and careers. Spencer Webb ’83, an EECS graduate and president of AntennaSys, drives with “ANTENNA.” He explains, “I changed directions eight years out of school and pursued my passion: antennas.” Meanwhile, IT manager and mechanical engineering alumna Sue Kayton ’78 has been the subject of envy with her California “NGINEER” plate: “People leave me notes on my windshield asking if they can buy this plate from me,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least three MIT couples have had dual vanity plates. Professors of economics Amy Finkelstein PhD ’01 and Benjamin Olken lovingly drive with dual plates that reflect both their work and their personal connection. “We got ourselves matching his-and-her ‘SUPPLY’ and ‘DEMAND’ license plates as an anniversary present,” Finkelstein says. “What better way is there to express the importance of a relationship? After all, supply is useless without demand and vice versa.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Says Laura Kiessling ’83, professor of chemistry: “My plate is ‘SLEX.’ This is the abbreviation for a carbohydrate called sialyl Lewis X. It has many roles, including a role in fertilization (sperm-egg binding). It tends to elicit many different reactions from people asking me what it means. Unless they are scientists, I say that my husband [Ron Raines ’80, professor of biology] gave it to me as an inside joke. My husband’s license plate is ‘PROTEIN.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor of the practice emerita Marcia Bartusiak of MIT Comparative Media Studies/Writing and her husband,&amp;nbsp;Stephen Lowe PhD ’88, previously shared a pair of related license plates. When the couple lived in Virginia, Lowe working as a mathematician on the structure of spiral galaxies and Bartusiak a young science writer focused on astronomy, they had “SPIRAL” and “GALAXY” plates. Now retired in Massachusetts, while they no longer have registered vanity plates, they’ve named their current vehicles “Redshift” and “Blueshift.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flori Pierri, assistant curator of science and technology at the MIT Museum, notes: “The MIT Museum has several sets of license plates that belonged to Warren Seamans, the museum’s founder and first director.” The collection includes 1970s iterations of “MITHC” (for MIT Historical Collections, the museum’s first name); a circa 1981 set of “HC-MIT” plates; and a plate reading “MITMUS” after the museum’s name formally changed to MIT Museum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other community members have had plates that make a nod to their hobbies — such as Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences and AeroAstro Professor Sara Seager, whose vehicle sports “ICANOE”; radio meteorologist and MIT Corporate Relations Senior Director Todd Glickman ’77, whose “WMBR 88” plate reflects his longtime connection with the Institute’s student radio station; AeroAstro alumnus Jeremy B. Katz ’09, who has “WAN2FLY” in Washington state; and filmmaker and former MIT pole vaulter Lila French '99, MEng '99, who drove with “SHE VLTR” (“she vaulter”) for a few years following graduation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still others use their plates to make poignant or playful statements or to connect with fellow drivers. Constantine Psimopoulos, a visiting lecturer in the MIT Educational Studies Program and former MIT cycling coach, drives with “EYZHN,” which comes from Ancient Greek. “Alexander the Great used to say that he owes ‘zhn’ (‘life’) to his parents, and ‘ey zhn’ (‘living well’) to his teacher Aristotle,” he says. Noelle Merritt ’85, who works at IBM, has “HIJKMNO” in California. “People should say ‘there’s no L’ (there’s Noelle),” she explains. “I was driving down the Pacific Coast Highway and a guy pulled up next to me and indicated I should roll down my window. I did, and he yelled, ‘Are you Noelle?’ He was quite excited he’d cracked the code!”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closer to campus, Katrina Norman, a lab operations manager in the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, zooms around Boston with “JETPAK” on her futuristic-looking Mazda Miata. And Julianna Mullen, communications director in the Plasma Science and Fusion Center, says of her “OMGWHY” plate: “It’s just an existential reminder of the importance of scientific inquiry, especially in traffic when someone cuts you off so they can get exactly two car lengths ahead. Oh my God, why did they do it?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article has been updated with additional license plate stories from the community.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When&amp;nbsp;Sophia Breslavets first heard about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/YuliasDream/" target="_blank"&gt;Yulia’s Dream&lt;/a&gt;, the MIT Department of Mathematics’ Program for Research in Mathematics, Engineering, and Science (PRIMES) for Ukrainian students,&amp;nbsp;Russia had just invaded her country, and she and her family lived in a town 20 miles from the Russian border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Breslavets had attended a school that emphasized mathematics and physics, took math classes on weekends and during summer breaks, and competed in math Olympiads.&amp;nbsp;“Math was really present in our lives,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But the war shifted her studies to online. “It still wasn’t like a fully functioning online school,” she recalls. “You can’t socialize.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;So she was grateful to be accepted to the MIT program in 2022. “Yulia’s Dream was a great thing to happen to me personally, because in the beginning, when the war was just starting, I didn't know what to do. This was just a great thing to take your mind off of what's going on outside your window, and you can just kind of get yourself into that and know that you have some work to do, and that was huge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second time around&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breslavets just finished up her second year in the online enrichment program, which offers&amp;nbsp;small-group math instruction in their native language and in English to Ukrainian high schoolers by mentors from around the world. Students wrap up the program by presenting their papers at a&lt;a href="https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/YuliasDream/YD-2024.html"&gt;&amp;nbsp;conference&lt;/a&gt;; several of those papers are published on&lt;a href="https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/YuliasDream/papers.html"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;arXiv.org&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This year’s conference&amp;nbsp;featured a guest talk by Professor&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://cse.umn.edu/math/pavlo-pylyavskyy"&gt;Pavlo Pylyavskyy&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, who discussed “Incidences and Tilings,” a joint work with Professor&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/math/people/faculty/fomin.html"&gt;Sergey Fomin&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The PRIMES program first organized Yulia’s Dream in 2022, named in memory of Yulia Zdanovska, a talented mathematician and computer scientist who was a teacher with Teach for Ukraine. She was 21 when she was killed in 2022 during Russian shelling in her home city of Kharkiv.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The program fulfills one of PRIMES’s goals, to expose students to the world community of research mathematics by connecting them with early-career mentors. Students must solve a challenging entrance problem set and are then referred by Ukrainian math teachers and leaders at math competitions and math camps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Yulia’s Dream is coordinated by Dmytro Matvieievskyi, a postdoc at the Kavli Institute in Tokyo, who graduated from School #27 of Kharkiv, and is a recipient of the Bronze medal at the 2012 International Math Olympiad (IMO) as part of the Ukraine Team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In its first year, from 2022 to 2023, the program drew 48 students in Phase I (reading) and 33 students in Phase II (reading and research). “Our expectation for 2022-23 was that each of six research groups would produce a research paper, and they all did, and one group continued working and produced an extra paper a few months after, for a total of&lt;a href="https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/YuliasDream/papers.html"&gt;&amp;nbsp;seven papers&lt;/a&gt;. Three papers are now on &lt;em&gt;arXiv.org&lt;/em&gt;, which is a mark of quality. This went beyond our expectations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This past year, the program provided guided reading and research supervision to 32 students. “We conduct thorough selection and provide opportunities to all Ukrainian students capable of doing advanced reading and/or research at the requisite level,” says PRIMES’s director Slava Gerovitch PhD ’99.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIT pipeline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Several students participated in both years, and at least two have been accepted to&amp;nbsp;MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One of those students is two-time Yulia’s Dream participant Nazar Korniichuk, who had&amp;nbsp;attended a high school in Kyiv that specialized in mathematics and physics when his education was disrupted by the war.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I was confused and did not know which way I should go,” he recalls. “But then I saw the program Yulia's Dream, and the desire to try real mathematical research ignited.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his first year in the program, participation was a challenge. “On the one hand, it was very difficult, because in certain periods there was no electricity and no water. There was always stress and uncertainty about tomorrow. But on the other hand, because there was a war, it motivated me to do mathematics even more, especially during periods when there was no electricity or water.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did complete his paper, with&amp;nbsp;Kostiantyn Molokanov and Severyn Khomych, and with mentor Darij Grinberg PhD ’16, a professor of mathematics at Drexel University: “&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18275"&gt;The Pak–Postnikov and Naruse skew hook length formulas: A new proof&lt;/a&gt;” (2 Oct 2023; arXiv.org, 27 Oct 2023).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Korniichuk completed his second round from his new home in Newton, Massachusetts, to which his family had migrated last summer. At the recent conference, he presented his paper, with co-authors&amp;nbsp;Kostiantyn Molokanov and Severyn Khomych, “Affine root systems via Lyndon words,” that they worked on with mentor Professor Oleksandr Tsymbaliuk of Purdue University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Yulia’s Dream was a very unique experience for me,” says Korniichuk, who plans to&amp;nbsp;study math and computer science at MIT.&amp;nbsp;“I had the opportunity to work on a difficult topic for a long time and then take part in writing an article. Although these years have been difficult, this program encouraged me to go forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;What makes the program work is providing a university level of instruction in mathematics research, to prepare high school students for top mathematics programs. In this case, it provides Ukrainian students an alternative route to reach their educational goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The core philosophy of the Yulia’s Dream experience is to provide “the best possible approximation to real mathematical research,”&amp;nbsp;math professor and PRIMES chief research advisor&lt;a href="https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=66"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Pavel Etingof&lt;/a&gt; told attendees at the 2024 conference. Etingof was born in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“In particular, all projects have to be real — i.e., of interest to professional research mathematicians — and the reading groups should be a bridge towards real mathematics as well. Also, the time frame of Yulia’s Dream is closer to that of real mathematical research than it is in any other high school research program: the students work on their projects for a whole year!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Other principles include an emphasis on writing and collaboration, with students working on teams with undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs, and faculty. There is also an emphasis on computer-assisted math, which “not only allows participation of high school students as equal members of our research teams, but also allows them to grasp abstract mathematical notions more easily,” says Pavel. “If such notions (such as group, ring, module, etc.) have an incarnation in the familiar digital world, they are less scary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Breslavets says that she especially appreciates the collaboration part of the program. Now 16,&amp;nbsp;Breslavets just finished her second year with Yulia’s Dream, and with&amp;nbsp;Andrii Smutchak presented “Double groupoids,” as mentored by University of Alberta professor Harshit Yadav. She says that they began working on the paper in October, and it&amp;nbsp;took about three months to write.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This year’s session was easier for her to participate in, because in summer 2022, her parents found her a host family in Connecticut so that she could transfer to St. Bernard’s School. Even with her new school’s great curriculum, she is grateful for the Yulia’s Dream program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Our high school program is considered to be advanced, and we have a class that’s called math research, but it’s definitely not the same, because [with Yulia’s Dream] you're working with people who actually do that for a living,” she says. “I learned a lot from both of my mentors. It’s so collaborative. They can give you feedback, and they can be honest about it.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;She says she misses her Ukrainian math community, which drifted apart after the Covid-19 pandemic and because of the war, but reports finding a new one with Yulia’s Dream. “I actually met a lot of new people,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Group collaboration is a huge goal for PRIMES director Slava Gerovitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Yulia’s Dream reflects the international nature of the mathematical community, with the mentors coming from different countries and working together with the students to advance knowledge for the whole of humanity. Our hope is that our students grow and mature as scholars and help rebuild the intellectual potential of Ukraine after the devastating war,” says Gerovitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/YuliasDream/index.html"&gt;Applications for next year’s program&lt;/a&gt; are now open. Math graduate students and postdocs are also invited to apply to be a mentor.&amp;nbsp;Weekly meetings begin in October, and culminate in a June 2025 conference to present papers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A butterfly’s wing is covered in hundreds of thousands of tiny scales like miniature shingles on a paper-thin roof. A single scale is as small as a speck of dust yet surprisingly complex, with a corrugated surface of ridges that help to wick away water, manage heat, and reflect light to give a butterfly its signature shimmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT researchers have now captured the initial moments during a butterfly’s metamorphosis, as an individual scale begins to develop this ridged pattern. The researchers used advanced imaging techniques to observe the microscopic features on a developing wing, while the butterfly transformed in its chrysalis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team continuously imaged individual scales as they grew out from the wing’s membrane. These images reveal for the first time how a scale’s initially smooth surface begins to wrinkle to form microscopic, parallel undulations. The ripple-like structures eventually grow into finely patterned ridges, which define the functions of an adult scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the scale’s transition to a corrugated surface is likely a result of “buckling” — a general mechanism that describes how a smooth surface wrinkles as it grows within a confined space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Buckling is an instability, something that we usually don’t want to happen as engineers,” says Mathias Kolle, associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT. “But in this context, the organism uses buckling to initiate the growth of these intricate, functional structures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team is working to visualize more stages of butterfly wing growth in hopes of revealing clues to how they might design advanced functional materials in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the multifunctionality of butterfly scales, we hope to understand and emulate these processes, with the aim of sustainably designing and fabricating new functional materials. These materials would exhibit tailored optical, thermal, chemical, and mechanical properties for textiles, building surfaces, vehicles — really, for generally any surface that needs to exhibit characteristics that depend on its micro- and nanoscale structure,” Kolle adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team has published their results in a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrp.2024.102063" target="_blank"&gt;study appearing today&lt;/a&gt; in the journal&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Cell Reports Physical Science&lt;/em&gt;. The study’s co-authors include first author and former MIT postdoc Jan Totz, joint first author and postdoc Anthony McDougal, graduate student Leonie Wagner, former postdoc&amp;nbsp;Sungsam Kang, professor of mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering Peter So, professor of mathematics Jörn Dunkel, and professor of material physics and chemistry Bodo Wilts of the University of Salzburg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A live transformation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/butterfly-wing-scales-growth-1122" target="_blank"&gt;In 2021&lt;/a&gt;, McDougal, Kolle and their colleagues developed an approach to continuously capture microscopic details of wing growth in a butterfly during its metamorphosis. Their method involved carefully cutting through the insect’s paper-thin chrysalis and peeling away a small square of cuticle to reveal the wing’s growing membrane. They placed a small glass slide over the exposed area, then used a microscope technique developed by team member Peter So to capture continuous images of scales as they grew out of the wing membrane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They applied the method to observe&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Vanessa cardui,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;a butterfly commonly known as a Painted Lady, which the team chose for its scale architecture, which is common to most lepidopteran species. They observed that Painted Lady scales grew along a wing membrane in precise, overlapping rows, like shingles on a rooftop. Those images provided scientists with the most continuous visualization of live butterfly wing scale growth at the microscale to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="/sites/default/files/images/inline/MIT-Butterfly-Buckling-03embed-press.jpg" data-entity-uuid="6e3a9e68-a742-479d-a1e4-963fd27be32b" data-entity-type="file" alt="Four images show the butterfly; the butterfly scales; the ridges of a single scale; and an extreme closeup of few ridges." data-caption="Series shows the Painted Lady butterfly (&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Vanessa cardui&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;); an optical micrograph of its scales; electron micrographs of a single scale; and the ridges on that scale. Scale bars 200µm, 20µm, and 2µm.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Image: Courtesy of the researchers&amp;amp;nbsp;" width="3000" height="776"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their new study, the team used the same approach to focus on a specific time window during scale development, to capture the initial formation of the finely structured ridges that run along a single scale in a living butterfly. Scientists know that these ridges, which run parallel to each other along the length of a single scale, like stripes in a patch of corduroy, enable many of the functions of the wing scales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since little is known about how these ridges are formed, the MIT team aimed to record the continuous formation of ridges in a live, developing butterfly, and decipher the organism’s ridge formation mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We watched the wing develop over 10 days, and got thousands of measurements of how the surfaces of scales changed on a single butterfly,” McDougal says. “We could see that early on, the surface is quite flat. As the butterfly grows, the surface begins to pop up a little bit, and then at around 41 percent of development,&amp;nbsp;we see this very regular pattern of completely popped up protoridges. This whole process happens over about five hours and lays the structural foundation for the subsequent expression of patterned ridges."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pinned down&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What might be causing the initial ridges to pop up in precise alignment? The researchers suspected that buckling might be at play. Buckling is a mechanical process by which a material bows in on itself as it is subjected to compressive forces. For instance, an empty soda can buckles when squeezed from the top, down. A material can also buckle as it grows, if it is constrained, or pinned in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have noted that, as the cell membrane of a butterfly’s scale grows, it is effectively pinned in certain places by actin bundles — long filaments that run under the growing membrane and act as a scaffold to support the scale as it takes shape. Scientists have hypothesized that actin bundles constrain a growing membrane, similar to ropes around an inflating hot air balloon. As the butterfly’s wing scale grows, they proposed, it would bulge out between the underlying actin filaments, buckling in a way that forms a scale’s initial, parallel ridges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this idea, the MIT team looked to a theoretical model that describes the general mechanics of buckling. They incorporated image data into the model, such as measurements of a scale membrane’s height at various early stages of development, and various spacings of actin bundles across a growing membrane. They then ran the model forward in time to see whether its underlying principles of mechanical buckling would produce the same ridge patterns that the team observed in the actual butterfly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With this modeling, we showed that we could go from a flat surface to a more undulating surface,” Kolle says. “In terms of mechanics, this indicates that buckling of the membrane is very likely what’s initiating the formation of these amazingly ordered ridges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to learn from nature, not only how these materials function, but also how they’re formed,” McDougal says. “If you want to for instance make a wrinkled surface, which is useful for a variety of applications, this gives you two really easy knobs to tune, to tailor how those surfaces are wrinkled. You could either change the spacing of where that material is pinned, or you could change the amount of material that you grow between the pinned sections. And we saw that the butterfly is using both of these strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was supported, in part, by the International Human Frontier Science Program Organization, the National Science Foundation, the Humboldt Foundation, and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Fannie and John Hertz Foundation&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.hertzfoundation.org/news/hertz-foundation-announces-2024-hertz-fellows/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it has awarded fellowships to 10 PhD students with ties to MIT. The prestigious award provides each recipient with five years of doctoral-level research funding (up to a total of $250,000), which allows them the flexibility and autonomy to pursue their own innovative ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fellows also receive lifelong access to Hertz Foundation programs, such as events, mentoring, and networking. They join the ranks of&amp;nbsp;over 1,300 former Hertz Fellows who are leaders and scholars in a range of fields in science, engineering, and technology. Connections among fellows over the years have sparked collaborations in startups, research, and technology commercialization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 10 MIT recipients are among a total of 18 Hertz Foundation Fellows scholars selected this year from across the country. Five of them received their undergraduate degrees at the Institute and will pursue their PhDs at other schools. Two are current MIT graduate students, and four will begin their studies here in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For more than 60 years, Hertz Fellows have led scientific and technical innovation in national security, applied biological sciences, materials research, artificial intelligence, space exploration, and more. Their contributions have been essential in advancing U.S. competitiveness,” says Stephen Fantone, chair of the Hertz Foundation board of directors and founder and president of Optikos Corp. “I’m excited to watch our newest Hertz Fellows as they pursue challenging research and continue the strong tradition of applying their work for the greater good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s MIT-affiliated awardees are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Owen Dugan ’24&lt;/strong&gt; graduated from MIT in just two-and-a-half years with a degree in physics, and he plans to pursue a PhD in computer science at Stanford University. His research interests lie at the intersection of AI and physics. As an undergraduate, he conducted research in a broad range of areas, including using physics concepts to enhance the speed of large language models and developing machine learning algorithms that automatically discover scientific theories. He was recognized with MIT’s Outstanding Undergraduate Research Award and is a U.S. Presidential Scholar, a Neo Scholar, and a Knight-Hennessy Scholar. Dugan holds multiple patents, co-developed an app to reduce food waste, and co-founded a startup that builds tools to verify the authenticity of digital images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kaylie Hausknecht&lt;/strong&gt; will begin her physics doctorate at MIT in the fall, having completing her undergraduate degree in physics and astrophysics at Harvard University. While there, her undergraduate research focused on developing&amp;nbsp;new machine learning techniques to solve problems in a range of fields, such as fluid dynamics, astrophysics, and condensed matter physics.&amp;nbsp;She received the Hoopes Prize for her senior thesis, was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa as a junior, and won two major writing awards. In addition, she completed five NASA internships. As an intern, she helped identify 301 new exoplanets using archival data from the Kepler Space Telescope. Hausknecht served as the co-president of Harvard’s chapter of Science Club for Girls, which works to encourage girls from underrepresented backgrounds to pursue STEM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elijah Lew-Smith&lt;/strong&gt; majored in physics at Brown University and plans to pursue a doctoral degree in physics at MIT. He is a theoretical physicist with broad intellectual interests in effective field theory (EFT), which is the study of systems with many interacting degrees of freedom. EFT reveals how to extract the relevant, long-distance behavior from complicated microscopic rules. In 2023, he received a national award to work on applying EFT systematically to non-equilibrium and active systems such as fluctuating hydrodynamics or flocking birds. In addition, Lew-Smith received a scholarship from the U.S. State Department to live for a year in Dakar, Senegal, and later studied at ’École Polytechnique in Paris, France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rupert Li ’24&lt;/strong&gt; earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees at MIT in mathematics as well as computer science, data science, and economics, with a minor in business analytics.He was named a 2024 Marshall Scholar and will study abroad for a year at Cambridge University before matriculating at Stanford University for a mathematics doctorate. As an undergraduate, Li authored 12 math research articles, primarily in combinatorics, but also including discrete geometry, probability, and harmonic analysis. He was recognized for his work with a Barry Goldwater Scholarship and an honorable mention for the Morgan Prize, one of the highest undergraduate honors in mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amani Maina-Kilaas&lt;/strong&gt; is a first-year doctoral student at MIT in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, where he studies computational psycholinguistics. In particular, he is interested in using artificial intelligence as a scientific tool to study how the mind works, and using what we know about the mind to develop more cognitively realistic models. Maina-Kilaas earned his bachelor’s degree in computer science and mathematics from Harvey Mudd College. There, he conducted research regarding intention perception and theoretical machine learning, earning the Astronaut Scholarship and Computing Research Association’s Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zoë Marschner&lt;/strong&gt; ’23 is a doctoral student at Carnegie Mellon University working on geometry processing, a subfield of computer graphics focused on how to represent and work with geometric data digitally; in her research, she aims to make these representations capable of enabling fundamentally better algorithms for solving geometric problems across science and engineering. As an undergraduate at MIT, she earned a bachelor’s degree in computer science and math and pursued research in geometry processing, including repairing hexahedral meshes and detecting intersections between high-order surfaces. She also interned at Walt Disney Animation Studios, where she worked on collision detection algorithms for simulation. Marschner is a recipient of the National Science Foundation’s Graduate Research Fellowship and the Goldwater Scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zijian (William) Niu&lt;/strong&gt; will start a doctoral program in computational and systems biology at MIT in the fall. He has a particular interest in developing new methods for imaging proteins and other biomolecules in their native cellular environments and using those data to build computational models for predicting their dynamics and molecular interactions. Niu received his bachelor’s degree in biochemistry, biophysics, and physics from the University of Pennsylvania. His undergraduate research involved developing novel computational methods for biological image analysis. He was awarded the Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship for creating a deep-learning algorithm for accurately detecting tiny diffraction-limited spots in fluorescence microscopy images that outperformed existing methods in quantifying spatial transcriptomics data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;James Roney&lt;/strong&gt; received his bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Harvard University in computer science and statistics, respectively. He is currently working as a machine learning research engineer at D.E. Shaw Research. His past research has focused on interpreting the internal workings of AlphaFold and modeling cancer evolution. Roney plans to pursue a PhD in computational biology at MIT, with a specific interest in developing computational models of protein structure, function, and evolution and using those models to engineer novel proteins for applications in biotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anna Sappington ’19&lt;/strong&gt; is a student in the Harvard University-MIT MD-PhD Program, currently in the first year of her doctoral program at MIT in electrical engineering and computer science. She is interested in building methods to predict evolutionary events, especially connections among machine learning, biology, and chemistry to develop reinforcement learning models inspired by evolutionary biology. Sappington graduated from MIT with a bachelor’s degree in computer science and molecular biology. As an undergraduate, she was awarded a 2018 Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship and selected as a Burchard Scholar and an Amgen Scholar. After graduating, she earned a master’s degree in genomic medicine from the University of Cambridge, where she studied as a Marshall Scholar, as well as a master’s degree in machine learning from University College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jason Yang ’22&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;received his bachelor’s degree in biology with a minor in computer science from MIT and is currently a doctoral student in genetics at Stanford University. He is interested in understanding the biological processes that underlie human health and disease. At MIT, and subsequently at Massachusetts General Hospital, Yang worked on the mechanisms involved in neurodegeneration in repeat expansion diseases, uncovering a novel molecular consequence of repeat protein aggregation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The sun’s surface is a brilliant display of sunspots and flares driven by the solar magnetic field, which is internally generated through a process called dynamo action. Astrophysicists have assumed that the sun’s field is generated deep within the star. But an MIT study finds that the sun’s activity may be shaped by a much shallower process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07315-1" target="_blank"&gt;paper appearing today&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, researchers at MIT, the University of Edinburgh, and elsewhere find that the sun’s magnetic field could arise from instabilities within the sun’s outermost layers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team generated a precise model of the sun’s surface and found that when they simulated certain perturbations, or changes in the flow of plasma (ionized gas) within the top 5 to 10 percent of the sun, these surface changes were enough to generate realistic magnetic field patterns, with similar characteristics to what astronomers have observed on the sun. In contrast, their simulations in deeper layers produced less realistic solar activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that sunspots and flares could be a product of a shallow magnetic field, rather than a field that originates deeper in the sun, as scientists had largely assumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The features we see when looking at the sun, like the corona that many people saw during the recent solar eclipse, sunspots, and solar flares, are all associated with the sun’s magnetic field,” says study author Keaton Burns, a research scientist in MIT’s Department of Mathematics. “We show that isolated perturbations near the sun’s surface, far from the deeper layers, can grow over time to potentially produce the magnetic structures we see.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the sun’s magnetic field does in fact arise from its outermost layers, this might give scientists a better chance at forecasting flares and geomagnetic storms that have the potential to damage satellites and telecommunications systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know the dynamo acts like a giant clock with many complex interacting parts,” says co-author Geoffrey Vasil, a researcher at the University of Edinburgh. “But we don't know many of the pieces or how they fit together. This new idea of how the solar dynamo starts is essential to understanding and predicting it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s co-authors also include Daniel Lecoanet and Kyle Augustson of Northwestern University, Jeffrey Oishi of Bates College, Benjamin Brown and Keith Julien of the University of Colorado at Boulder, and Nicholas Brummell of the University of California at Santa Cruz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flow zone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sun is a white-hot ball of plasma that’s boiling on its surface. This boiling region is called the “convection zone,” where layers and plumes of plasma roil and flow. The convection zone comprises the top one-third of the sun’s radius and stretches about 200,000 kilometers below the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the basic ideas for how to start a dynamo is that you need a region where there’s a lot of plasma moving past other plasma, and that shearing motion converts kinetic energy into magnetic energy,” Burns explains. “People had thought that the sun’s magnetic field is created by the motions at the very bottom of the convection zone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To pin down exactly where the sun’s magnetic field originates, other scientists have used large three-dimensional simulations to try to solve for the flow of plasma throughout the many layers of the sun’s interior. “Those simulations require millions of hours on national supercomputing facilities, but what they produce is still nowhere near as turbulent as the actual sun,” Burns says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than simulating the complex flow of plasma throughout the entire body of the sun, Burns and his colleagues wondered whether studying the stability of plasma flow near the surface might be enough to explain the origins of the dynamo process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this idea, the team first used data from the field of “helioseismology,” where scientists use observed vibrations on the sun’s surface to determine the average structure and flow of plasma beneath the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you take a video of a drum and watch how it vibrates in slow motion, you can work out the drumhead’s shape and stiffness from the vibrational modes,” Burns says. “Similarly, we can use vibrations that we see on the solar surface to infer the average structure on the inside.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solar onion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their new study, the researchers collected models of the sun’s structure from helioseismic observations.&amp;nbsp;“These average flows look sort like an onion, with different layers of plasma rotating past each other,” Burns explains. “Then we ask: Are there perturbations, or tiny changes in the flow of plasma, that we could superimpose on top of this average structure, that might grow to cause the sun’s magnetic field?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To look for such patterns, the team utilized the Dedalus Project — a numerical framework that Burns developed that can simulate many types of fluid flows with high precision. The code has been applied to a wide range of problems, from modeling the dynamics inside individual cells, to ocean and atmospheric circulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My collaborators have been thinking about the solar magnetism problem for years, and the capabilities of Dedalus have now reached the point where we could address it,” Burns says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team developed algorithms that they incorporated into Dedalus to find self-reinforcing changes in the sun’s average surface flows. The algorithm discovered new patterns that could grow and result in realistic solar activity. In particular, the team found patterns that match the locations and timescales of sunspots that have been have observed by astronomers since Galileo in 1612.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunspots are transient features on the surface of the sun that are thought to be shaped by the sun’s magnetic field. These relatively cooler regions appear as dark spots in relation to the rest of the sun’s white-hot surface. Astronomers have long observed that sunspots occur in a cyclical pattern, growing and receding every 11 years, and generally gravitating around the equator, rather than near the poles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the team’s simulations, they found that certain changes in the flow of plasma, within just the top 5 to 10 percent of the sun’s surface layers, were enough to generate magnetic structures in the same regions. In contrast, changes in deeper layers produce less realistic solar fields that are concentrated near the poles, rather than near the equator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team was motivated to take a closer look at flow patterns near the surface as conditions there resembled the unstable plasma flows in entirely different systems: the accretion disks around black holes. Accretion disks are massive disks of gas and stellar dust that rotate in towards a black hole, driven by the “magnetorotational instability,” which generates turbulence in the flow and causes it to fall inward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burns and his colleagues suspected that a similar phenomena is at play in the sun, and that the magnetorotational instability in the sun’s outermost layers could be the first step in generating the sun’s magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think this result may be controversial,” he ventures. “Most of the community has been focused on finding dynamo action deep in the sun. Now we’re showing there’s a different mechanism that seems to be a better match to observations.” Burns says that the team is continuing to study if the new surface field patterns can generate individual sunspots and the full 11-year solar cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is far from the final word on the problem,” says Steven Balbus, a professor of astronomy at Oxford University, who was not involved with the study. “However, it is a fresh and very promising avenue for further study. The current findings are very suggestive and the approach is innovative, and not in line with the current received wisdom. When the received wisdom has not been very fruitful for an extended period, something more creative is indicated, and that is what this work offers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was supported, in part, by&amp;nbsp;NASA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Eleven MIT undergraduates, graduate students, and alumni have won Fulbright grants to embark on projects overseas in the 2024-25 grant cycle. Two other students were offered awards but declined them to pursue other opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funded by the U.S. Department of State, the Fulbright U.S. Student Program offers year-long opportunities for American citizen students and recent alumni to conduct independent research, pursue graduate studies, or teach English in over 140 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT has been a Fulbright Top-Producing Institution for five years in a row. MIT students and alumni interested in applying to the Fulbright U.S. Student Program should contact Julia Mongo, MIT Fulbright program advisor, in the Office of Distinguished Fellowships in Career Advising and Professional Development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April Cheng&lt;/strong&gt; is a junior studying physics with a minor in mathematics and is fast-tracked to graduate this spring. They will take their Fulbright research grant to the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Potsdam, Germany, where they will study different statistical techniques to infer the expansion rate of the universe from gravitational waves. They first developed an interest in gravitational waves and black holes at the MIT LIGO and Caltech LIGO labs, but their research spans a wide range of topics in astrophysics, including cosmology and fast radio bursts. Cheng is passionate about physics education and is heavily involved in developing educational materials for high school Science Olympiads. At MIT, they are a member of the Physics Values Committee, the physics mentorship program, and the MIT Lion Dance team. After Fulbright, Cheng will pursue a PhD in astrophysics at Princeton University, where they have received the President’s Fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grace McMillan&lt;/strong&gt; is a senior majoring in literature and mechanical engineering with a concentration in Russian language. As a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant Award recipient, she will teach at a university in Kazakhstan. McMillan’s interest in Central Asia was sparked by a Russian language immersion program she participated in during her sophomore summer in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, funded by MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives (MISTI). She is excited to help her students learn English to foster integration into the global academic community. During her time at MIT, McMillan has conducted research with faculty in nuclear science; earth, atmospheric, and planetary sciences; and the Digital Humanities Lab. Outside of academics, she has been an active member of her sorority, Sigma Kappa, and has served on the MIT Health Consumers’ Advisory Council for two years. After Fulbright, McMillan hopes to attend law school, focusing on education reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ryan McTigue&lt;/strong&gt; will graduate this spring with a BS in physics and mathematics and a concentration in Spanish. With a Fulbright award to Spain, he will do research at the University of Valencia’s Institute of Molecular Science focusing on the physics of two-dimensional multiferroic nanodevices. He is looking forward to improving his Spanish and getting the opportunity to live abroad. At MIT, McTigue became interested in condensed matter physics research with the Checkelsky group, where he focused on engineering materials with flat bands that exhibited correlated electron effects. Outside of research, McTigue has been a mentor in the physics department’s mentoring program and a member of the heavyweight men’s crew team. After his Fulbright grant, McTigue will begin a PhD in physics at Princeton University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keith Murray ’22&lt;/strong&gt; graduated from MIT with a BS in computation and cognition and linguistics and philosophy. He will receive his MEng degree in computation and cognition this spring. As a Fulbright Hungary research grantee at the HUN-REN Wigner Research Centre for Physics, Murray will design generative AI models inspired by the primary visual cortex with the goal of making AI models more interpretable. At MIT, Murray’s research experiences spanned from training mice to perform navigation tasks in virtual reality to theorizing about how neurons might compute modular arithmetic. He was also a member of the men’s heavyweight crew team and the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. After Fulbright, Murray will pursue a PhD in neuroscience at Princeton University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maaya Prasad ’22&lt;/strong&gt; completed her undergraduate education at MIT with degrees in both electrical engineering and creative writing and will graduate this month with an MS in mechanical and ocean engineering. Her thesis research focuses on microplastic detection using optical sensing. Prasad’s Fulbright fellowship will take her to Mauritius, an East African island country located in the Indian Ocean. Here, she will continue her master’s research at the University of Mauritius and will work with local researchers to implement a microplastic survey system. While at MIT, Prasad joined the varsity sailing team with no prior experience. Her time spent on the water led her to pursue marine research at MIT Sea Grant, and she eventually earned an honorable mention to the 2023 All-American Sailing Team. After Fulbright, Prasad hopes to pursue a PhD in applied ocean engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anusha Puri&lt;/strong&gt; is a senior majoring in biological engineering. Her Fulbright award will take her to Lausanne, Switzerland, where she will conduct cancer immunology research at the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research. At MIT, Puri’s work in the Weinberg Lab focused on understanding mechanisms that drive resistance of breast cancer to immunotherapy. On campus, she founded and serves as president of MIT’s premiere stand-up comedy group, Stand-Up CoMITy, leads MIT’s Bhangra dance team, and is the editor-in-chief of the &lt;em&gt;MIT Undergraduate Research Journal&lt;/em&gt;. She looks forward to engaging with teaching outreach and practicing her French in Switzerland. After her Fulbright grant, she plans to pursue a PhD in biomedical science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Olivia Rosenstein&lt;/strong&gt; will graduate this spring with a BS in physics and a minor in French. Her Fulbright will take her to ENS Paris-Saclay in Palaiseau, France, where she’ll deepen her education in atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics. At MIT, Rosenstein has worked in Professor Mark Vogelsberger’s group researching models of galaxy formation and the early universe, and in Professor Richard Fletcher’s group on an erbium-lithium experiment to investigate quantum many-body dynamics in a degenerate mixture. In France, she will expand on the skills she developed in Fletcher’s lab by contributing to a project using optical tweezer arrays to study dipolar interactions. After Fulbright, Rosenstein plans to return to the United States to pursue a PhD in experimental AMO at Caltech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Schug&lt;/strong&gt;willreceive this spring an MEng degree in the Climate, Environment, and Sustainability track within the MIT Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. During her Fulbright year in Italy, she will conduct research on carbon storage in the Venice lagoon at the University of Padua. Schug is excited to build upon her research with the Terrer Lab at MIT, where she is currently investigating the effectiveness of forestation as a carbon sequestration strategy. She also looks forward to improving her Italian language skills and learning about Italian history and culture. Before beginning Fulbright this fall, Schug will study ecological preservation in Sicily this summer through an MIT-Italy collaboration with the University of Catania. After Fulbright, she hopes to continue researching nature-based solutions as climate change mitigation strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaibhavi Shah ’21&lt;/strong&gt; earned a BS in biological engineering and in science, technology, and society at MIT, where she was named a Goldwater Scholar. She is now a medical student at Stanford University. As a Fulbright-Fogarty Fellow in Public Health, Shah will use both her computational and humanities backgrounds to investigate sociocultural factors underlying traumatic surgical injuries in Nepal. While at MIT, she was on the executive board of GlobeMed and the Society of Women Engineers, and she hopes to use those experiences to amplify diverse voices in medicine while on her journey to becoming a neurosurgeon-scientist. After Fulbright, Shah will complete her final year of medical school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charvi Sharma&lt;/strong&gt; is a senior studying computer science and molecular biology with a minor in theater arts. As a Fulbright English teaching assistant in Spain, she is excited to engage in cross-cultural exchange while furthering her skills as a teacher and as a leader. In addition to teaching, Sharma looks forward to immersing herself in the country’s vibrant traditions, improving her Spanish proficiency, and delving into the local arts and dance scene. At MIT, through Global Teaching Labs Spain and her roles as a dynaMIT mentor, an associate advisor, and a captain and president of her dance teams Mirchi and Nritya, Sharma has served as a teacher of both STEM and dance. Her passion for making a difference in her community is also evident through her work with Boston Medical Center’s Autism Program through the PKG Public Service Center and as an undergraduate cancer researcher in the Yaffe Lab. After Fulbright, Sharma plans to pursue an MD and, ultimately, a career as a clinician-scientist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isabella Witham&lt;/strong&gt; is a senior majoring in biological engineering. As a recipient of the Fulbright U.S.-Korea Presidential STEM Initiative Award, she will conduct research at Seoul National University’s Biomimetic Materials and Stem Cell Engineering Lab. Her work will involve creating biomimetic scaffolds for pancreatic cell transplantation to treat type I diabetes. While in South Korea, Witham aims to improve her language skills and explore cultural sites and cities. At MIT, she worked in the Belcher Lab on nanoparticle formulations, was a tutor for MIT’s Women’s Technology Program, and volunteered as a Medlink. After her Fulbright fellowship, she plans to pursue a PhD in biological engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Senior math major Janabel Xia is a study of a person in constant motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When she isn’t sorting algorithms and improving traffic control systems for driverless vehicles, she’s dancing&amp;nbsp;as a member of at least four dance clubs. She’s joined several social justice organizations,&amp;nbsp;worked on cryptography and web authentication technology, and created a polling app that allows users to vote anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In her final semester, she’s putting the pedal to the metal, with a green light to lessen the carbon footprint of urban transportation by using sensors at traffic light intersections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Growing up in Lexington, Massachusetts, Janabel has been competing on math teams since elementary school. On her math team, which met early mornings before the start of school, she discovered a love of problem-solving that challenged her more than her classroom “plug-and-chug exercises.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;At Lexington High School, she was math team captain, a two-time Math Olympiad attendee, and a silver medalist for Team USA at the&lt;a href="https://www.egmo.org/"&gt;&amp;nbsp;European Girls' Mathematical Olympiad.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As a math major, she studies&amp;nbsp;combinatorics and theoretical computer science, including&amp;nbsp;theoretical and applied cryptography. In her sophomore year, she was a researcher in the Cryptography and Information Security Group at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, where she conducted cryptanalysis research under Professor&lt;a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/vinodv/"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Vinod Vaikuntanathan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Part of her interests in cryptography stem from the beauty of the underlying mathematics itself —&amp;nbsp;the field feels like clever engineering with mathematical tools. But another part of her interest in cryptography stems from its political dimensions, including its potential to fundamentally change existing power structures and governance. Xia, along with students Ratan Kaliani (University of California at Berkeley), Darya Kaviani (UC Berkeley), and Molly Cantillon (Stanford University), created&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://zkpoll.xyz/"&gt;zkPoll&lt;/a&gt;, a private polling app written with the Circom programming language, that allows users to create polls for specific sets of people, while generating a zero-knowledge proof that keeps personal information hidden to decrease negative voting influences from public perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Her&amp;nbsp;participation in the PKG Center’s&lt;a href="https://firstyear.mit.edu/orientation/pre-orientation-programs-fpops/ace-active-community-engagement/"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Active Community Engagement&lt;/a&gt; Freshman Pre-Orientation Program introduced her to&amp;nbsp;local community organizations focusing on food security, housing for formerly incarcerated individuals, and access to health care. She is also part of&lt;a href="https://engage.mit.edu/readingforrevolution/home/"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Reading for Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, a student book club that discusses race, class, and working-class movements within MIT and the Greater Boston area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Xia’s educational journey led to her ongoing pursuit of combining mathematical and computational methods in areas adjacent to urban planning.&amp;nbsp; “When I realized how much planning was concerned with social justice as it was concerned with design, I became more attracted to the field.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going on autopilot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;She took classes with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://dusp.mit.edu/home"&gt;Department of Urban Studies and Planning&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;is currently working on&amp;nbsp;an Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) project with Professor Cathy Wu in the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Recent work on eco-driving by Wu and doctoral student&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://vindulamj.github.io/"&gt;Vindula Jayawardana&lt;/a&gt; investigated semi-autonomous vehicles that communicate with sensors localized at traffic intersections, which in theory could reduce carbon emissions by up to 21 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Xia aims to optimize the implementation scheme for these sensors at traffic intersections, considering a graded scheme where perhaps only 20 percent of all sensors are initially installed, and more sensors get added in waves. She wants to maximize the emission reduction rates at each step of the process, as well as ensure there is no unnecessary installation and de-installation of such sensors.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dance numbers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Meanwhile, Xia has been a member of MIT’s&lt;a href="http://fixation.mit.edu/"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Fixation&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://ridonk.mit.edu/"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Ridonkulous&lt;/a&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;MissBehavior groups, and as a traditional Chinese dance choreographer for the&lt;a href="http://adt.mit.edu/"&gt;&amp;nbsp;MIT Asian Dance Team&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A dancer since she was 3, Xia started with Chinese traditional dance, and later added ballet and jazz. Because she is as much of a dancer as a researcher, she has figured out how to make her schedule work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Production weeks are always madness, with dancers running straight from class to dress rehearsals and shows all evening and coming back early next morning to take down lights and roll up marley [material that covers the stage floor],” she says. “As busy as it keeps me, I couldn’t have survived MIT without dance. I love the discipline, creativity, and most importantly the teamwork that dance demands of us. I really love the dance community here with my whole heart. These friends have inspired me and given me the love to power me through MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Xia lives with her fellow Dance Team members at the off-campus&lt;a href="http://wilg.mit.edu/"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Women's Independent Living Group&lt;/a&gt; (WILG).&amp;nbsp; “I really value WILG's culture of independence, both in lifestyle — cooking, cleaning up after yourself, managing house facilities, etc. — and thought — questioning norms, staying away from status games, finding new passions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In addition to her UROP, she’s wrapping up some graduation requirements, finishing up a research paper on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://ecajournal.haifa.ac.il/Volume2024/ECA2024_S2A23.pdf"&gt;sorting algorithms&lt;/a&gt; from her summer at the University of Minnesota Duluth Research Experience for Undergraduates in combinatorics, and deciding between PhD programs in math and computer science.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“My biggest goal right now is to figure out how to combine my interests in mathematics and urban studies, and more broadly connect technical perspectives with human-centered work in a way that feels right to me,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Overall, MIT has given me so many avenues to explore that I would have never thought about before coming here, for which I’m infinitely grateful. Every time I find something new, it’s hard for me not to find it cool. There’s just so much out there to learn about. While it can feel overwhelming at times, I hope to continue that learning and exploration for the rest of my life.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When water freezes, it transitions from a liquid phase to a solid phase, resulting in a drastic change in properties like density and volume. Phase transitions in water are so common most of us probably don’t even think about them, but phase transitions in novel materials or complex physical systems are an important area of study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fully understand these systems, scientists must be able to recognize phases and detect the transitions between. But how to quantify phase changes in an unknown system is often unclear, especially when data are scarce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from MIT and the University of Basel in Switzerland applied generative artificial intelligence models to this problem, developing a new machine-learning framework that can automatically map out phase diagrams for novel physical systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their physics-informed machine-learning approach is more efficient than laborious, manual techniques which rely on theoretical expertise. Importantly, because their approach leverages generative models, it does not require huge, labeled training datasets used in other machine-learning techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a framework could help scientists investigate the thermodynamic properties of novel materials or detect entanglement in quantum systems, for instance. Ultimately, this technique could make it possible for scientists to discover unknown phases of matter autonomously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you have a new system with fully unknown properties, how would you choose which observable quantity to study? The hope, at least with data-driven tools, is that you could scan large new systems in an automated way, and it will point you to important changes in the system. This might be a tool in the pipeline of automated scientific discovery of new, exotic properties of phases,” says Frank Schäfer, a postdoc in the Julia Lab in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and co-author of a paper on this approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joining Schäfer on the paper are first author Julian Arnold, a graduate student at the University of Basel; Alan Edelman, applied mathematics professor in the Department of Mathematics and leader of the Julia Lab; and senior author Christoph Bruder, professor in the Department of Physics at the University of Basel. The research is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.207301" target="_blank"&gt;published today&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Physical Review Letters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detecting phase transitions using AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While water transitioning to ice might be among the most obvious examples of a phase change, more exotic phase changes, like when a material transitions from being a normal conductor to a superconductor, are of keen interest to scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These transitions can be detected by identifying an “order parameter,” a quantity that is important and expected to change. For instance, water freezes and transitions to a solid phase (ice) when its temperature drops below 0 degrees Celsius. In this case, an appropriate order parameter could be defined in terms of the proportion of water molecules that are part of the crystalline lattice versus those that remain in a disordered state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, researchers have relied on physics expertise to build phase diagrams manually, drawing on theoretical understanding to know which order parameters are important. Not only is this tedious for complex systems, and perhaps impossible for unknown systems with new behaviors, but it also introduces human bias into the solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, researchers have begun using machine learning to build discriminative classifiers that can solve this task by learning to classify a measurement statistic as coming from a particular phase of the physical system, the same way such models classify an image as a cat or dog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT researchers demonstrated how generative models can be used to solve this classification task much more efficiently, and in a physics-informed manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://julia.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Julia Programming Language&lt;/a&gt;, a popular language for scientific computing that is also used in MIT’s introductory linear algebra classes, offers many tools that make it invaluable for constructing such generative models, Schäfer adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generative models, like those that underlie ChatGPT and Dall-E, typically work by estimating the probability distribution of some data, which they use to generate new data points that fit the distribution (such as new cat images that are similar to existing cat images).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when simulations of a physical system using tried-and-true scientific techniques are available, researchers get a model of its probability distribution for free. This distribution describes the measurement statistics of the physical system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A more knowledgeable model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT team’s insight is that this probability distribution also defines a generative model upon which a classifier can be constructed. They plug the generative model into standard statistical formulas to directly construct a classifier instead of learning it from samples, as was done with discriminative approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a really nice way of incorporating something you know about your physical system deep inside your machine-learning scheme. It goes far beyond just performing feature engineering on your data samples or simple inductive biases,” Schäfer says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This generative classifier can determine what phase the system is in given some parameter, like temperature or pressure. And because the researchers directly approximate the probability distributions underlying measurements from the physical system, the classifier has system knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This enables their method to perform better than other machine-learning techniques. And because it can work automatically without the need for extensive training, their approach significantly enhances the computational efficiency of identifying phase transitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, similar to how one might ask ChatGPT to solve a math problem, the researchers can ask the generative classifier questions like “does this sample belong to phase I or phase II?” or “was this sample generated at high temperature or low temperature?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists could also use this approach to solve different binary classification tasks in physical systems, possibly to detect entanglement in quantum systems (Is the state entangled or not?) or determine whether theory A or B is best suited to solve a particular problem. They could also use this approach to better understand and improve large language models like ChatGPT by identifying how certain parameters should be tuned so the chatbot gives the best outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, the researchers also want to study theoretical guarantees regarding how many measurements they would need to effectively detect phase transitions and estimate the amount of computation that would require.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was funded, in part, by the Swiss National Science Foundation, the MIT-Switzerland Lockheed Martin Seed Fund, and MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT senior Elaine Siyu Liu doesn’t own an electric car, or any car. But she sees the impact of electric vehicles (EVs) and renewables on the grid as two pieces of an energy puzzle she wants to solve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Energy reports that the number of public and private EV charging ports nearly doubled in the past three years, and many more are in the works. Users expect to plug in at their convenience, charge up, and drive away. But what if the grid can’t handle it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electricity demand, long stagnant in the United States, has spiked due to EVs, data centers that drive artificial intelligence, and industry. Grid planners forecast an increase of 2.6 percent to 4.7 percent in electricity demand over the next five years, according to data reported to federal regulators. Everyone from EV charging-station operators to utility-system operators needs help navigating a system in flux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s where Liu’s work comes in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liu, who is studying mathematics and electrical engineering and computer science (EECS), is interested in distribution — how to get electricity from a centralized location to consumers. “I see power systems as a good venue for theoretical research as an application tool,” she says. “I'm interested in it because I'm familiar with the optimization and probability techniques used to map this level of problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liu grew up in Beijing, then after middle school moved with her parents to Canada and enrolled in a prep school in Oakville, Ontario, 30 miles outside Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liu stumbled upon an opportunity to take part in a regional math competition and eventually started a math club, but at the time, the school’s culture surrounding math surprised her. Being exposed to what seemed to be some students’ aversion to math, she says, “I don’t think my feelings about math changed. I think my feelings about how people feel about math changed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liu brought her passion for math to MIT. The summer after her sophomore year, she took on the first of the two Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program projects she completed with electric power system expert Marija Ilić, a joint adjunct professor in EECS and a senior research scientist at the MIT Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predicting the grid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2022, with the help of funding from the MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI), Liu has been working with&amp;nbsp;Ilić on identifying ways in which the grid is challenged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One factor is the addition of renewables to the energy pipeline. A gap in wind or sun might cause a lag in power generation. If this lag occurs during peak demand, it could mean trouble for a grid already taxed by extreme weather and other unforeseen events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think of the grid as a network of dozens of interconnected parts, once an element in the network fails — say, a tree downs a transmission line — the electricity that used to go through that line needs to be rerouted. This may overload other lines, creating what’s known as a cascade failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This all happens really quickly and has very large downstream effects,” Liu says. “Millions of people will have instant blackouts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if the system can handle a single downed line, Liu notes that “the nuance is that there are now a lot of renewables, and renewables are less predictable. You can't predict a gap in wind or sun. When such things happen, there’s suddenly not enough generation and too much demand. So the same kind of failure would happen, but on a larger and more uncontrollable scale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renewables’ varying output has the added complication of causing voltage fluctuations. “We plug in our devices expecting a voltage of 110, but because of oscillations, you will never get exactly 110,” Liu says. “So even when you can deliver enough electricity, if you can't deliver it at the specific voltage level that is required, that’s a problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liu and Ilić are building a model to predict how and when the grid might fail. Lacking access to privatized data, Liu runs her models with European industry data and test cases made available to universities. “I have a fake power grid that I run my experiments on,” she says. “You can take the same tool and run it on the real power grid.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liu’s model predicts cascade failures as they evolve. Supply from a wind generator, for example, might drop precipitously over the course of an hour. The model analyzes which substations and which households will be affected. “After we know we need to do something, this prediction tool can enable system operators to strategically intervene ahead of time,” Liu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dictating price and power&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Liu turned her attention to EVs, which provide a different kind of challenge than renewables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, S&amp;amp;P Global reported that lawmakers argued that the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) wholesale power rate structure was unfair for EV charging station operators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to operators paying by the kilowatt-hour, some also pay more for electricity during peak demand hours. Only a few EVs charging up during those hours could result in higher costs for the operator even if their overall energy use is low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anticipating how much power EVs will need is more complex than predicting energy needed for, say, heating and cooling. Unlike buildings, EVs move around, making it difficult to predict energy consumption at any given time. “If users don't like the price at one charging station or how long the line is, they'll go somewhere else,” Liu says. “Where to allocate EV chargers is a problem that a lot of people are dealing with right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One approach would be for FERC to dictate to EV users when and where to charge and what price they'll pay. To Liu, this isn’t an attractive option. “No one likes to be told what to do,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liu is looking at optimizing a market-based solution that would be acceptable to top-level energy producers — wind and solar farms and nuclear plants — all the way down to the municipal aggregators that secure electricity at competitive rates and oversee distribution to the consumer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the location, movement, and behavior patterns of all the EVs driven daily in Boston and other major energy hubs, she notes, could help demand aggregators determine where to place EV chargers and how much to charge consumers, akin to Walmart deciding how much to mark up wholesale eggs in different markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Liu presented the work at MITEI’s annual research conference. This spring, Liu and&amp;nbsp;Ilić are submitting a paper on the market optimization analysis to a journal of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liu has come to terms with her early introduction to attitudes toward STEM that struck her as markedly different from those in China. She says, “I think the (prep) school had a very strong ‘math is for nerds’ vibe, especially for girls. There was a ‘why are you giving yourself more work?’ kind of mentality. But over time, I just learned to disregard that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After graduation, Liu, the only undergraduate researcher in&amp;nbsp;Ilić’s MIT Electric Energy Systems Group, plans to apply to fellowships and graduate programs in EECS, applied math, and operations research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on her analysis, Liu says that the market could effectively determine the price and availability of charging stations. Offering incentives for EV owners to charge during the day instead of at night when demand is high could help avoid grid overload and prevent extra costs to operators. “People would still retain the ability to go to a different charging station if they chose to,” she says. “I'm arguing that this works.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The National Academy of Sciences has elected 120 members and 24 international members, including five faculty members from MIT. Guoping Feng, Piotr Indyk, Daniel J. Kleitman, Daniela Rus, and Senthil Todadri were elected in recognition of their “distinguished and continuing achievements in original research.” Membership to the National Academy of Sciences is one of the highest honors a scientist can receive in their career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Among the new members added this year are also nine MIT alumni, including Zvi Bern ’82; Harold Hwang ’93, SM ’93; Leonard Kleinrock SM ’59, PhD ’63; Jeffrey C. Lagarias ’71, SM ’72, PhD ’74; Ann Pearson PhD ’00; Robin Pemantle PhD ’88; Jonas C. Peters PhD ’98; Lynn Talley PhD ’82; and Peter T. Wolczanski ’76. Those elected this year bring the total number of active members to 2,617, with 537 international members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The National Academy of Sciences is a private, nonprofit institution that was established under a congressional charter signed by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863. It recognizes achievement in science by election to membership, and — with the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Medicine — provides science, engineering, and health policy advice to the federal government and other organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guoping Feng&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Guoping Feng is the James W. (1963) and Patricia T. Poitras Professor in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences. He is also associate director and investigator in the McGovern Institute for Brain Research, a member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and director of the Hock E. Tan and K. Lisa Yang Center for Autism Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;His research focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate the development and function of synapses, the places in the brain where neurons connect and communicate. He’s interested in how defects in the synapses can contribute to psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. By understanding the fundamental mechanisms behind these disorders, he’s producing foundational knowledge that may guide the development of new treatments for conditions like obsessive-compulsive disorder and schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Feng received his medical training at Zhejiang University Medical School in Hangzhou, China, and his PhD in molecular genetics from the State University of New York at Buffalo. He did his postdoctoral training at Washington University at St. Louis and was on the faculty at Duke University School of Medicine before coming to MIT in 2010. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and was elected to the National Academy of Medicine in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Piotr Indyk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Piotr Indyk is the Thomas D. and Virginia W. Cabot Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. He received his magister degree from the University of Warsaw and his PhD from Stanford University before coming to MIT in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Indyk’s research focuses on building efficient, sublinear, and streaming algorithms. He’s developed, for example, algorithms that can use limited time and space to navigate massive data streams, that can separate signals into individual frequencies faster than other methods, and can address the “nearest neighbor” problem by finding highly similar data points without needing to scan an entire database. His work has applications on everything from machine learning to data mining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;He has been named a Simons Investigator and a fellow of the Association for Computer Machinery. In 2023, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel J. Kleitman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Daniel Kleitman, a professor emeritus of applied mathematics, has been at MIT since 1966. He received his undergraduate degree from Cornell University and his master's and PhD in physics from Harvard University before doing postdoctoral work at Harvard and the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Kleitman’s research interests include operations research, genomics, graph theory, and combinatorics, the area of math concerned with counting. He was actually a professor of physics at Brandeis University before changing his field to math, encouraged by the prolific mathematician Paul Erdős. In fact, Kleitman has the rare distinction of having an Erdős number of just one. The number is a measure of the “collaborative distance” between a mathematician and Erdős in terms of authorship of papers, and studies have shown that leading mathematicians have particularly low numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;He’s a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and has made important contributions to the MIT community throughout his career. He was head of the Department of Mathematics and served on a number of committees, including the Applied Mathematics Committee. He also helped create web-based technology and an online textbook for several of the department’s core undergraduate courses. He was even a math advisor for the MIT-based film&amp;nbsp;“Good Will Hunting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniela Rus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Daniela Rus, the Andrew (1956) and Erna Viterbi Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, is the director of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). She also serves as director of the Toyota-CSAIL Joint Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Her research on robotics, artificial intelligence, and data science is geared toward understanding the science and engineering of autonomy. Her ultimate goal is to create a future where machines are seamlessly integrated into daily life to support people with cognitive and physical tasks, and deployed in way that ensures they benefit humanity. She’s working to increase the ability of machines to reason, learn, and adapt to complex tasks in human-centered environments with applications for agriculture, manufacturing, medicine, construction, and other industries. She’s also interested in creating new tools for designing and fabricating robots and in improving the interfaces between robots and people, and she’s done collaborative projects at the intersection of technology and artistic performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Rus received her undergraduate degree from the University of Iowa and her PhD in computer science from Cornell University. She was a professor of computer science at Dartmouth College before coming to MIT in 2004. She is part of the Class of 2002 MacArthur Fellows; was elected to the National Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; and is a fellow of the Association for Computer Machinery, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Senthil Todadri&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Senthil Todadri, a professor of physics, came to MIT in 2001. He received his undergraduate degree from the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur and his PhD from Yale University before working as a postdoc at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Todadri’s research focuses on condensed matter theory. He’s interested in novel phases and phase transitions of quantum matter that expand beyond existing paradigms. Combining modeling experiments and abstract methods, he’s working to develop a theoretical framework for describing the physics of these systems. Much of that work involves understanding the phenomena that arise because of impurities or strong interactions between electrons in solids that don’t conform with conventional physical theories. He also pioneered the theory of deconfined quantum criticality, which describes a class of phase transitions, and he discovered the dualities of quantum field theories in two dimensional superconducting states, which has important applications to many problems in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Todadri has been named a Simons Investigator, a Sloan Research Fellow, and a fellow of the American Physical Society. In 2023, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT senior Owen Dugan, graduate student Vittorio Colicci ’22, predoctoral research fellow Carine You ’22, and recent alumna Carina Letong Hong ’22 are recipients of this year’s Knight-Hennessy Scholarships. The competitive fellowship, now in its seventh year, funds up to three years of graduate studies in any field at Stanford University. To date, 22 MIT students and alumni have been awarded Knight-Hennessy Scholarships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are excited for these students to continue their education at Stanford with the generous support of the Knight Hennessy Scholarship,” says Kim Benard, associate dean of distinguished fellowships in Career Advising and Professional Development. “They have all demonstrated extraordinary dedication, intellect, and leadership, and this opportunity will allow them to further hone their skills to make real-world change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vittorio Colicci ’22&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vittorio Colicci, from Trumbull, Connecticut, graduated from MIT in May 2022 with a BS in aerospace engineering and physics. He will receive his master’s degree in planetary sciences this spring. At Stanford, Colicci will pursue a PhD in earth and planetary sciences at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability. He hopes to investigate how surface processes on Earth and Mars have evolved through time alongside changes in habitability. Colicci has worked largely on spacecraft engineering projects, developing a monodisperse silica ceramic for electrospray thrusters and fabricating high-energy diffraction gratings for space telescopes. As a Presidential Graduate Fellow at MIT, he examined the influence of root geometry on soil cohesion for early terrestrial plants using 3D-printed reconstructions. Outside of research, Colicci served as co-director of TEDxMIT and propulsion lead for the MIT Rocket Team. He is also passionate about STEM engagement and outreach, having taught educational workshops in Zambia and India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Owen Dugan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owen Dugan, from Sleepy Hollow, New York, is a senior majoring in physics. As a Knight-Hennessy Scholar, he will pursue a PhD in computer science at the Stanford School of Engineering. Dugan aspires to combine artificial intelligence and physics, developing AI that enables breakthroughs in physics and using physics techniques to design more capable and safe AI systems. He has collaborated with researchers from Harvard University, the University of Chicago, and DeepMind, and has presented his first-author research at venues including the International Conference on Machine Learning, the MIT Mechanistic Interpretability Conference, and the American Physical Society March Meeting. Among other awards, Dugan is a Hertz Finalist, a U.S. Presidential Scholar, an MIT Outstanding Undergraduate Research Awardee, a Research Science Institute Scholar, and a Neo Scholar. He is also a co-founder of VeriLens, a funded startup enabling trust on the internet by cryptographically verifying digital media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carina Letong Hong ’22&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carina Letong Hong, from Canton, China, is currently pursuing a JD/PhD in mathematics at Stanford. A first-generation college student, Hong graduated from MIT in May 2022 with a double major in mathematics and physics and was inducted into Sigma Pi Sigma, the physics honor society. She then earned a neuroscience master’s degree with dissertation distinctions from the University of Oxford, where she conducted artificial intelligence and machine learning research at Sainsbury Wellcome Center’s Gatsby Unit. At Stanford Law School, Hong provides legal aid to low-income workers and uses economic analysis to push for law enforcement reform.

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT students Ben Lou, Srinath Mahankali, and Kenta Suzuki have been selected to receive Barry Goldwater Scholarships for the 2024-25 academic year. They are among just 438 recipients from across the country selected based on academic merit from an estimated pool of more than 5,000 college sophomores and juniors, approximately 1,350 of whom were nominated by their academic institution to compete for the scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1989, the Barry Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Foundation has awarded nearly 11,000 Goldwater scholarships to support undergraduates who intend to pursue research careers in the natural sciences, mathematics, and engineering and have the potential to become leaders in their respective fields. Past scholars have gone on to win an impressive array of prestigious postgraduate fellowships. Almost all, including the three MIT recipients, intend to obtain doctorates in their area of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ben Lou&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ben Lou is a third-year student originally from San Diego, California, majoring in physics and math with a minor in philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My research interests are scattered across different disciplines,” says Lou. “I want to draw from a wide range of topics in math and physics, finding novel connections between them, to push forward the frontier of knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since January 2022, he has worked with Nergis Mavalvala, dean of the School of Science, and Hudson Loughlin, a graduate student in the LIGO group, which studies the detection of gravitational waves. Lou is working with them to advance the field of quantum measurement and better understand quantum gravity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ben has enormous intellectual horsepower and works with remarkable independence,” writes Mavalvala in her recommendation letter. “I have no doubt he has an outstanding career in physics ahead of him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lou, for his part, is grateful to Mavalvala and Loughlin, as well as all of his scientific mentors that have supported him along his research path. That includes MIT professors Alan Guth and Barton Zwiebach, who introduced him to quantum physics, as well as his first-year advisor, Richard Price; current advisor, Janet Conrad; Elijah Bodish and Roman Bezrukavnikov in the Department of Mathematics; and David W. Brown of the San Diego Math Circle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of his future career goals, Lou wants to be a professor of theoretical physics and study, as he says, the “fundamental aspects of reality” while also inspiring students to love math and physics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to his research, Lou is currently the vice president of the Assistive Technology Club at MIT and actively engaged in raising money for Spinal Muscular Atrophy research. In the future, he’d like to continue his philanthropy work and use his personal experience to advise an assistive technology company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Srinath Mahankali&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Srinath Mahankali is a third-year student from New York City majoring in computer science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since June 2022, Mahankali has been an undergraduate researcher in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Working with Pulkit Agrawal, assistant professor of electrical engineering and computer science and head of the Improbable AI Lab, Mahankali’s research is on training robots. Currently, his focus is on training quadruped robots to move in an energy-efficient manner and training agents to interact in environments with minimal feedback. But in the future, he’d like to develop robots that can complete athletic tasks like gymnastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The experience of discussing research with Srinath is similar to discussions with the best PhD students in my group,” writes Agrawal in his recommendation letter. “He is fearless, willing to take risks, persistent, creative, and gets things done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before coming to MIT, Mahankali was a 2021 Regeneron STS scholar, which is one of the oldest and most prestigious awards for math and science students. In 2020, he was also a participant in the MIT PRIMES program, studying objective functions in optimization problems with Yunan Yang, an assistant professor of math at Cornell University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m deeply grateful to all my research advisors for their invaluable mentorship and guidance,” says Mahankali, extending his thanks to PhD students Zhang-Wei Hong and Gabe Margolis, as well as assistant professor of math at Brandeis, Promit Ghosal, and all of the organizers of the PRIMES program. “I’m also very grateful to all the members of the Improbable AI Lab for their support, encouragement, and willingness to help and discuss any questions I have,”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, Mahankali wants to obtain a PhD and one day lead his own lab in robotics and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenta Suzuki&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenta Suzuki is a third-year student majoring in mathematics from Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, and Tokyo, Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, Suzuki works with professor of mathematics Roman Bezrukavnikov on research at the intersection of number and representation theory, using geometric methods to represent p-adic groups. Suzuki has also previously worked with math professors Wei Zhang and Zhiwei Yun, crediting the latter with inspiring him to pursue research in representation theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his recommendation letter, Yun writes, “Kenta is the best undergraduate student that I have worked with in terms of the combination of raw talent, mathematical maturity, and research abilities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before coming to MIT, Suzuki was a Yau Science Award USA finalist in 2020, receiving a gold in math, and he received honorable mention from the Davidson Institute Fellows program in 2021. He also participated in the MIT PRIMES program in 2020. Suzuki credits his PRIMES mentor, Michael Zieve at the University of Michigan, with giving him his first taste of mathematical research. In addition, he extended his thanks to all of his math mentors, including the organizers of MIT Summer Program in Undergraduate Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After MIT, Suzuki intends to obtain a PhD in pure math, continuing his research in representation theory and number theory and, one day, teaching at a research-oriented institution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Barry Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Program was established by U.S. Congress in 1986 to honor Senator Barry Goldwater, a soldier and national leader who served the country for 56 years. Awardees receive scholarships of up to $7,500 a year to cover costs related to tuition, room and board, fees, and books.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT faculty members Roger Levy, Tracy Slatyer, and Martin Wainwright are among 188 scientists, artists, and scholars awarded &lt;a href="https://www.gf.org/news/fellows-news/announcing-the-2024-guggenheim-fellows/"&gt;2024 fellowships&lt;/a&gt; from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. Working across 52 disciplines, the fellows were selected from almost 3,000 applicants for “prior career achievement and exceptional promise.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each fellow receives a monetary stipend to pursue independent work at the highest level. Since its founding in 1925, the Guggenheim Foundation has awarded over $400 million in fellowships to more than 19,000 fellows. This year, MIT professors were recognized in the categories of neuroscience, physics, and data science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bcs.mit.edu/directory/roger-levy" target="_blank"&gt;Roger Levy&lt;/a&gt; is a professor in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences. Combining computational modeling of large datasets with psycholinguistic experimentation, his work furthers our understanding of the cognitive underpinning of language processing, and helps to design models and algorithms that will allow machines to process human language. He is a recipient of the Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship, the NSF Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award, and a fellowship at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/tracy-slatyer/" target="_blank"&gt;Tracy Slatyer&lt;/a&gt; is a professor in the Department of Physics as well as the &lt;a href="https://physics.mit.edu/research/labs-centers/center-for-theoretical-physics/"&gt;Center for Theoretical Physics&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="https://web.mit.edu/lns/"&gt;MIT Laboratory for Nuclear Science&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://space.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research&lt;/a&gt;. Her research focuses on dark matter&amp;nbsp;— novel theoretical models, predicting observable signals, and analysis of astrophysical and cosmological datasets. She was a co-discoverer of the giant gamma-ray structures known as the “Fermi Bubbles” erupting from the center of the Milky Way, for which she received the New Horizons in Physics Prize in 2021. She is also a recipient of a Simons Investigator Award and Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/martin-wainwright/" target="_blank"&gt;Martin Wainwright&lt;/a&gt; is the Cecil H. Green Professor in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Mathematics, and affiliated with the &lt;a href="https://lids.mit.edu/"&gt;Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://stat.mit.edu/"&gt;Statistics and Data Science Center&lt;/a&gt;. He is interested in statistics, machine learning, information theory, and optimization. Wainwright has been recognized with an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellowship, the Medallion Lectureship and Award from the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, and the COPSS Presidents’ Award from the Joint Statistical Societies. Wainwright has also co-authored books on graphical and statistical modeling, and solo-authored a book on high dimensional statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Humanity faces some profound existential challenges,” says Edward Hirsch, president of the foundation. “The Guggenheim Fellowship is a life-changing recognition. It’s a celebrated investment into the lives and careers of distinguished artists, scholars, scientists, writers and other cultural visionaries who are meeting these challenges head-on and generating new possibilities and pathways across the broader culture as they do so.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2024/study-demonstrates-efficacy-mit-led-brave-behind-bars-program-0424</guid>
        <dc:creator>Rachel Gordon | MIT CSAIL</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, a team of scientists from MIT and the University of Massachusetts at Lowell designed and deployed a first-of-its-kind web programming course for incarcerated individuals across multiple correctional facilities. The program, &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/brave-behind-bars-mit-prison-education-computing-skills-for-women-0119"&gt;Brave Behind Bars&lt;/a&gt;, uses virtual classroom technology to deliver web design training to students behind prison walls. The program brought together men and women from gender-segregated facilities to learn fundamentals in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, helping them to create websites addressing social issues of their own choosing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program is accredited through three collaborating universities: Georgetown University, Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology, and Washington County Community College. In a &lt;a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/hcie/files/research-projects/bbb/From_Prisons_to_Programming.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;new open-access paper&lt;/a&gt; about the project, the team analyzed its impact: They used a multi-pronged approach, gathering insights through comprehensive surveys with participants from dichotomous and open-ended questions. The results painted a powerful narrative of increased self-efficacy — a crucial marker for successful reentry into the workforce and society — among incarcerated learners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Education has long been recognized as a pivotal factor in reducing recidivism and fostering successful reentry," says Martin Nisser, an MIT PhD candidate in electrical engineering and computer science (EECS), affiliate of the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), and lead author of the paper. "By equipping incarcerated learners with invaluable digital literacy skills and boosting their self-efficacy, our program aims to foster the skills necessary to thrive in today's technology-driven world."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strength of Brave Behind Bars is manifested vividly through the impactful websites created by the students. One project, "End Homelessness Statewide," provided vital resources to help unhoused individuals find temporary and permanent shelter. Another website, "The PinkPrint," addressed the unique challenges incarcerated women face, serving as a "blueprint" with educational resources and gender-responsive support. Equally remarkable was "No Excuse for Domestic Abuse," which raised awareness about the prevalence of domestic violence while offering a lifeline to victims seeking help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mixed-methods research study evaluated how the 12-week, college-accredited course was faring. "Our qualitative study in 2022 involving thematic analyses of post-course surveys from 34 students revealed overwhelmingly positive feedback, with students reporting increased self-confidence, motivation, and a sense of empowerment from learning web programming skills. The themes we uncovered highlighted the powerful effect of the program on students' self-beliefs," says Nisser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The urgency of such work cannot be understated, as underscored by the alarmingly high rates of recidivism, the rate at which formerly incarcerated individuals are rearrested leading to re-conviction. A central cause of mass incarceration, data shows that an estimated 68 percent of people released from U.S. jails or prisons were arrested within three years between 2005 and 2014, rising to 83 percent within nine years. However, a meta-analysis spanning 37 years of research (1980-2017) revealed a promising trend: Incarcerated individuals who participate in post-secondary educational programs are 28 percent less likely to return to prison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joblessness among the formerly incarcerated can be as high as 60 percent a year after release. Almost two-thirds of those who secure employment enter jobs typically available to people with little or no education, such as waste management, manufacturing, and construction — jobs increasingly being automated or outsourced.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While both the demand and supply of AI curricula in higher education have sky-rocketed, these have not typically served disadvantaged people, who must be caught up in foundational digital literacy. The ability to skillfully navigate computers and the internet is becoming essential for post-release employment in the modern workplace, as well as to navigate the economic, social, and health-related resources that are now embedded in our digital technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other part was a quantitative study in 2023, with 37 participants measuring general computer programming self-efficacy using validated scales before and after the course. The authors saw an increase in mean scores for general self-efficacy and digital literacy after the course, but the pre- and post-course measures of self-efficacy were not statistically significantly different. This challenge, the team says, is common in carceral environments, where meta-analyses of multiple studies with less significant results are often needed to achieve statistical significance and draw meaningful conclusions. The authors also acknowledge that their quantitative study contributes to this data pool, and they are conducting new courses to gather more data for future comprehensive statistical analyses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"By providing incarcerated individuals with an opportunity to develop digital literacy, the Brave Behind Bars program facilitates self-efficacy through a novel education model designed not only to expand access to the internet for individuals but also to teach them the navigation and web design skills needed to connect and engage with the communities to which they will return," says UMass Lowell professor and chair of the School of Criminology and Justice Studies April Pattavina, who was not involved in the research. "I applaud the team's dedication in implementing the program and look forward to longer-term evaluations on graduates when they leave prison so we can learn about the extent to which the program transforms lives on the outside."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One student, reflecting on the impact of the Brave Behind Bars program, says, "This class has shown me that I am human again, and I deserve to have a better quality of life post-incarceration." In an environment where individuals can too often be made to feel like numbers, a program is underway to demonstrate that these individuals can be seen once more as people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted by a team of experts from MIT and UMass Lowell. Leading the team was Martin Nisser, who wrote the paper alongside Marisa Gaetz, a PhD student in the MIT Department of Mathematics; Andrew Fishberg, a PhD student in the MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics; and Raechel Soicher, assistant director of research and evaluation at the MIT Teaching and Learning Laboratory. Faraz Faruqi, an MIT PhD student in EECS and CSAIL affiliate, contributed significantly to the project. Completing the team, Joshua Long brought his expertise from UMass Lowell, adding a unique perspective to the collaborative effort.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Improving drug development with a vast map of the immune system</title>

    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2024/immunai-improving-drug-development-with-immune-system-map-0411</guid>
        <dc:creator>Zach Winn | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human immune system is a network made up of trillions of cells that are constantly circulating throughout the body. The cellular network orchestrates interactions with every organ and tissue to carry out an impossibly long list of functions that scientists are still working to understand. All that complexity limits our ability to predict which patients will respond to treatments and which ones might suffer debilitating side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue often leads pharmaceutical companies to stop developing drugs that could help certain patients, halting clinical trials even when drugs show promising results for some people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Immunai is helping to predict how patients will respond to treatments by building a comprehensive map of the immune system. The company has assembled a vast database it calls AMICA, that combines multiple layers of gene and protein expression data in cells with clinical trial data to match the right drugs to the right patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our starting point was creating what I call the Google Maps for the immune system,” Immunai co-founder and CEO Noam Solomon says. “We started with single-cell RNA sequencing, and over time we’ve added more and more ‘omics’: genomics, proteomics, epigenomics, all to measure the immune system’s cellular expression and function, to measure the immune environment holistically. Then we started working with pharmaceutical companies and hospitals to profile the immune systems of patients undergoing treatments to really get to the root mechanisms of action and resistance for therapeutics.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immunai’s big data foundation is a result of its founders’ unique background. Solomon and co-founder Luis Voloch ’13, SM ’15 hold degrees in mathematics and computer science. In fact, Solomon was a postdoc in MIT’s Department of Mathematics at the time of Immunai’s founding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solomon frames Immunai’s mission as stopping the decades-long divergence of computer science and the life sciences. He believes the single biggest factor driving the explosion of computing has been Moore’s Law — our ability to exponentially increase the number of transistors on a chip over the past 60 years. In the pharmaceutical industry, the reverse is happening: By &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3681" target="_blank"&gt;one estimate&lt;/a&gt;, the cost of developing a new drug roughly doubles every nine years. The phenomenon has been dubbed Eroom’s Law (“Eroom” for “Moore” spelled backward).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solomon sees the trend eroding the case for developing new drugs, with huge consequences for patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;should pharmaceutical companies invest in discovery if they won’t get a return on investment?” Solomon asks. “Today, there’s only a 5 to 10 percent chance that any given clinical trial will be successful. What we’ve built through a very robust and granular mapping of the immune system is a chance to improve the preclinical and clinical stages of drug development.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A change in plans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solomon entered Tel Aviv University when he was 14 and earned his bachelor’s degree in computer science by 19. He earned two PhDs in Israel, one in computer science and the other in mathematics, before coming to MIT in 2017 as a postdoc to continue his mathematical research career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That year Solomon met Voloch, who had already earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in math and computer science from MIT. But the researchers were soon exposed to a problem that would take them out of their comfort zones and change the course of their careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voloch’s grandfather was receiving a cocktail of treatments for cancer at the time. The cancer went into remission, but he suffered terrible side effects that caused him to stop taking his medication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voloch and Solomon began wondering if their expertise could help patients like Voloch’s grandfather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When we realized we could make an impact, we made the difficult decision to stop our academic pursuits and start a new journey,” Solomon recalls. “That was the starting point for Immunai.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voloch and Solomon soon partnered with Immunai scientific co-founders Ansu Satpathy, a researcher at Stanford University at the time, and Danny Wells, a researcher at the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy. Satpathy and Wells had shown that single-cell RNA sequencing could be used to gain insights into why patients respond differently to a common cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team began analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data published in scientific papers, trying to link common biomarkers with patient outcomes. Then they integrated data from the United Kingdom’s Biobank public health database, finding they were able to improve their models’ predictions. Soon they were incorporating data from hospitals, academic research institutions, and pharmaceutical companies, analyzing information about the structure, function, and environment of cells — multiomics — to get a clearer picture of immune activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Single cell sequencing gives you metrics you can measure in thousands of cells, where you can look at 20,000 different genes, and those metrics give you an immune profile,” Solomon explains. “When you measure all of that over time, especially before and after getting therapy, and compare patients who do respond with patients who don’t, you can apply machine learning models to understand why.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those data and models make up AMICA, what Immunai calls the world’s largest cell-level immune knowledge base. AMICA stands for Annotated Multiomic Immune Cell Atlas. It analyzes single cell multiomic data from almost 10,000 patients and bulk-RNA data from 100,000 patients across more than 800 cell types and 500 diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the core of Immunai’s approach is a focus on the immune system, which other companies shy away from because of its complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We don't want to be like other groups that are studying mainly tumor microenvironments,” Solomon says. “We look at the immune system because the immune system is the common denominator. It’s the one system that is implicated in every disease, in your body’s response to everything that you encounter, whether it's a viral infection or bacterial infection or a drug that you are receiving — even how you are aging.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turning data into better treatments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immunai has already partnered with some of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world to help them identify promising treatments and set up their clinical trials for success. Immunai's insights can help partners make critical decisions about treatment schedules, dosing, drug combinations, patient selection, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Everyone is talking about AI, but I think the most exciting aspect of the platform we have built is the fact that it's vertically integrated, from wet lab to computational modeling with multiple iterations,” Solomon says. “For example, we may do single-cell immune profiling of patient samples, then we upload that data to the cloud and our computational models come up with insights, and with those insights we do in vitro or in vivo validation to see if our models are right and iteratively improve them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately Immunai wants to enable a future where lab experiments can more reliably turn into impactful new recommendations and treatments for patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;Scientists can cure nearly every type of cancer, but only in mice,” Solomon says. “In preclinical models we know how to cure cancer. In human beings, in most cases, we still don't. To overcome that, most scientists are looking for better ex vivo or in vivo models. Our approach is to be more agnostic as to the model system, but feed the machine with more and more data from multiple model systems.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;We’re demonstrating that our algorithms can repeatedly beat the top benchmarks in identifying the top preclinical immune features that match to patient outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For the fourth time in the history of the annual &lt;a href="https://maa.org/math-competitions/william-lowell-putnam-mathematical-competition"&gt;William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition&lt;/a&gt;, and for the fourth year in a row, all five of the top spots in the contest, known as Putnam Fellows, came from a single school: MIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putnam Fellows include three individuals who ranked in the top five in previous years — sophomores Papon Lapate and Luke Robitaille and junior Brian Liu — plus junior Ankit Bisain and first-year Jiangqi Dai. Each receives an award of $2,500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT’s 2023 Putnam Team, made up of Bisain, Lapate, and Robitaille, also finished in first place — MIT’s eighth first-place win in the past 10 competitions. Teams are based on the three top scorers from each institution. The institution with the first-place team receives a $25,000 award, and each team member receives $1,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competition's top-scoring woman, first-year Isabella Zhu, received the Elizabeth Lowell Putnam Prize, which includes a $1,000 award. She is the seventh MIT student to receive this honor since the award began in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, 68 out of the top 100 test-takers who took the exam on Dec. 2, 2023, were MIT students. Beyond the top five scorers, MIT students took eight of the next 11 spots (each awarded $1,000), seven of the next 10 after that (each awarded $250), and 48 out of a total of 75 honorable mentions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contest also listed 29 MIT students who finished in the 101-200 spots, which means a total of 97 of the 200 top Putnam participants — nearly half — were MIT undergraduates. There were also 52 MIT students in the 201-500 finishers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am incredibly proud of our students’ amazing effort and performance at the Putnam Competition,” says associate professor of mathematics &lt;a href="https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=1354"&gt;Yufei Zhao&lt;/a&gt; ’10, PhD ’15. Zhao is also a three-time Putnam Fellow.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exam is considered to be the most prestigious university-level mathematics competition in the United States and Canada. MIT students filled Walker Memorial in December to take what is notoriously a very difficult exam; while a perfect score is 120, the median score this year was just 10 points. But even just coming out to take the six-hour exam was applauded by the Department of Mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Beyond the truly stellar achievements of our undergraduate population, it is also amazing to see the participation rate, another sign that MIT students love mathematics!" says Professor Michel Goemans, head of the MIT Department of Mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our performance is historically unprecedented and astonishing,” says MIT Math Community and Outreach Officer &lt;a href="https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=2614"&gt;Michael King&lt;/a&gt;, who has also taken the exam. “The atmosphere in the testing room, with hundreds of students wrestling intensely with challenging problems, was amazing. Any student who participated, whether they made some progress on one problem or completely solved many, should be celebrated.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several ways that students can prepare for the grueling test. The &lt;a href="https://uma.mit.edu/"&gt;Undergraduate Mathematics Association&lt;/a&gt; hosts fun Putnam practice events, and Zhao teaches class &lt;a href="https://yufeizhao.com/a34/"&gt;18.A34 &lt;/a&gt;(Mathematical Problem Solving), known as the Putnam Seminar, which brings together first-year students who are interested in the annual competition. Zhao notes that his seminar, and the competition in general, also helps new students to form a supportive community.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The math department offers other ways to encourage students to bond over their love of problem-solving, such as Pi Day and Puzzle Nights. “MIT is truly a unique place to be a math major,” says Zhao.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half of the top scorers are alumni of another STEM-student magnet, MIT math’s &lt;a href="http://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/index.php"&gt;PRIMES&lt;/a&gt; (Program for Research in Mathematics, Engineering and Science) high school outreach program. Three of this year’s Putnam Fellows (Bisain, Liu, and Robitaille) are PRIMES alumni, as are four of the next top 11, and six out of the next 10 winners, along with many of the students receiving honorable mentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Every year, former PRIMES students take a prominent place among Putnam winners,” says Pavel Etingof, a math professor who is also PRIMES’s chief research advisor. “For the third year in a row, three out of five Putnam Fellows are PRIMES alumni, all of them from MIT. Through PRIMES, MIT recruits the best mathematical talent in the nation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the Putnam competition officials have MIT ties, including the Putnam Problems Committee’s Karl Mahlburg, a 2006 MIT math postdoc, and &lt;a href="https://alum.mit.edu/directory/#"&gt;Greta Panova &lt;/a&gt;’05; and among those contributing additional competition problems were math professor and former MIT Putnam coach &lt;a href="https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=263"&gt;Richard Stanley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://alum.mit.edu/directory/#"&gt;Gabriel Drew Carroll&lt;/a&gt; PhD ’12,&amp;nbsp; and &lt;a href="https://alum.mit.edu/directory/#"&gt;Darij Grinberg&lt;/a&gt; PhD ’16.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tamara Broderick first set foot on MIT’s campus when she was a high school student, as a participant in the inaugural &lt;a href="https://web.mit.edu/wtp/" target="_blank"&gt;Women’s Technology Program&lt;/a&gt;. The monthlong summer academic experience gives young women a hands-on introduction to engineering and computer science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the probability that she would return to MIT years later, this time as a faculty member?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a question Broderick could probably answer quantitatively using Bayesian inference, a statistical approach to probability that tries to quantify uncertainty by continuously updating one’s assumptions as new data are obtained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her lab at MIT, the newly tenured associate professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) uses Bayesian inference to quantify uncertainty and measure the robustness of data analysis techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ve always been really interested in understanding not just ‘What do we know from data analysis,’ but ‘How well do we know it?’” says Broderick, who is also a member of the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems and the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society. “The reality is that we live in a noisy world, and we can’t always get exactly the data that we want. How do we learn from data but at the same time recognize that there are limitations and deal appropriately with them?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly, her focus is on helping people understand the confines of the statistical tools available to them and, sometimes, working with them to craft better tools for a particular situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, her group recently collaborated with oceanographers to develop a machine-learning model that can make &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/new-machine-learning-model-ocean-currents-0517" target="_blank"&gt;more accurate predictions about ocean currents&lt;/a&gt;. In another project, she and others worked with degenerative disease specialists on a &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/system-helps-severely-motor-impaired-individuals-type-more-quickly-accurately-0405" target="_blank"&gt;tool that helps severely motor-impaired individuals&lt;/a&gt; utilize a computer’s graphical user interface by manipulating a single switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common thread woven through her work is an emphasis on collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Working in data analysis, you get to hang out in everybody’s backyard, so to speak. You really can’t get bored because you can always be learning about some other field and thinking about how we can apply machine learning there,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hanging out in many academic “backyards” is especially appealing to Broderick, who struggled even from a young age to narrow down her interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A math mindset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up in a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, Broderick had an interest in math for as long as she can remember. She recalls being fascinated by the idea of what would happen if you kept adding a number to itself, starting with 1+1=2 and then 2+2=4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was maybe 5 years old, so I didn’t know what ‘powers of two’ were or anything like that. I was just really into math,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her father recognized her interest in the subject and enrolled her in a Johns Hopkins program called the Center for Talented Youth, which gave Broderick the opportunity to take three-week summer classes on a range of subjects, from astronomy to number theory to computer science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, in high school, she conducted astrophysics research with a postdoc at Case Western University. In the summer of 2002, she spent four weeks at MIT as a member of the first class of the Women’s Technology Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She especially enjoyed the freedom offered by the program, and its focus on using intuition and ingenuity to achieve high-level goals. For instance, the cohort was tasked with building a device with LEGOs that they could use to biopsy a grape suspended in Jell-O.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program showed her how much creativity is involved in engineering and computer science, and piqued her interest in pursuing an academic career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But when I got into college at Princeton, I could not decide — math, physics, computer science — they all seemed super-cool. I wanted to do all of it,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She settled on pursuing an undergraduate math degree but took all the physics and computer science courses she could cram into her schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digging into data analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After receiving a Marshall Scholarship, Broderick spent two years at Cambridge University in the United Kingdom, earning a master of advanced study in mathematics and a master of philosophy in physics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK, she took a number of statistics and data analysis classes, including her first class on Bayesian data analysis in the field of machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a transformative experience, she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“During my time in the U.K., I realized that I really like solving real-world problems that matter to people, and Bayesian inference was being used in some of the most important problems out there,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the U.S., Broderick headed to the University of California at Berkeley, where she joined the lab of Professor Michael I. Jordan as a grad student. She earned a PhD in statistics with a focus on Bayesian data analysis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She decided to pursue a career in academia and was drawn to MIT by the collaborative nature of the EECS department and by how passionate and friendly her would-be colleagues were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her first impressions panned out, and Broderick says she has found a community at MIT that helps her be creative and explore hard, impactful problems with wide-ranging applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been lucky to work with a really amazing set of students and postdocs in my lab — brilliant and hard-working people whose hearts are in the right place,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of her team’s recent projects involves a collaboration with an economist who studies the use of microcredit, or the lending of small amounts of money at very low interest rates, in impoverished areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of microcredit programs is to raise people out of poverty. Economists run randomized control trials of villages in a region that receive or don’t receive microcredit. They want to generalize the study results, predicting the expected outcome if one applies microcredit to other villages outside of their study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Broderick and her collaborators have found that results of some microcredit studies can be very brittle. Removing one or a few data points from the dataset can completely change the results. One issue is that researchers often use empirical averages, where a few very high or low data points can skew the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using machine learning, she and her collaborators developed a method that can determine how many data points must be dropped to change the substantive conclusion of the study. With their tool, a scientist can see how brittle the results are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes dropping a very small fraction of data can change the major results of a data analysis, and then we might worry how far those conclusions generalize to new scenarios. Are there ways we can flag that for people? That is what we are getting at with this work,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, she is continuing to collaborate with researchers in a range of fields, such as genetics, to understand the pros and cons of different machine-learning techniques and other data analysis tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happy trails&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploration is what drives Broderick as a researcher, and it also fuels one of her passions outside the lab. She and her husband enjoy collecting patches they earn by hiking all the trails in a park or trail system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think my hobby really combines my interests of being outdoors and spreadsheets,” she says. “With these hiking patches, you have to explore everything and then you see areas you wouldn’t normally see. It is adventurous, in that way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ve discovered some amazing hikes they would never have known about, but also embarked on more than a few “total disaster hikes,” she says. But each hike, whether a hidden gem or an overgrown mess, offers its own rewards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just like in her research, curiosity, open-mindedness, and a passion for problem-solving have never led her astray.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was updated on April 23 to reflect the promotion of Gosha Geogdzhayev from alternate to winner of the Gates Cambridge Scholarship.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT seniors Gosha Geogdzhayev and Sadhana Lolla have won the prestigious Gates Cambridge Scholarship, which offers students an opportunity to pursue graduate study in the field of their choice at Cambridge University in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Established in 2000, Gates Cambridge offers full-cost post-graduate scholarships to outstanding applicants from countries outside of the U.K. The mission of Gates Cambridge is to build a global network of future leaders committed to improving the lives of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gosha Geogdzhayev&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally from New York City, Geogdzhayev is a senior majoring in physics with minors in mathematics and computer science. At Cambridge, Geogdzhayev intends to pursue an MPhil in quantitative climate and environmental science. He is interested in applying these subjects to climate science and intends to spend his career developing novel statistical methods for climate prediction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At MIT, Geogdzhayev researches climate emulators with Professor Raffaele Ferrari’s group in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences and is part of the “Bringing Computation to the Climate Challenge” Grand Challenges project. He is currently working on an operator-based emulator for the projection of climate extremes. Previously, Geogdzhayev studied the statistics of changing chaotic systems, work that has recently been published as a first-author paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a recipient of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) Hollings Scholarship, Geogdzhayev has worked on bias correction methods for climate data at the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. He is the recipient of several other awards in the field of earth and atmospheric sciences, notably the American Meteorological Society Ward and Eileen Seguin Scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of research, Geogdzhayev enjoys writing poetry and is actively involved with his living community, Burton 1, for which he has previously served as floor chair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sadhana Lolla&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lolla, a senior from Clarksburg, Maryland, is majoring in computer science and minoring in mathematics and literature. At Cambridge, she will pursue an MPhil in technology policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, Lolla aims to lead conversations on deploying and developing technology for marginalized communities, such as the rural Indian village that her family calls home, while also conducting research in embodied intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At MIT, Lolla conducts research on safe and trustworthy robotics and deep learning at the Distributed Robotics Laboratory with Professor Daniela Rus. Her research has spanned debiasing strategies for autonomous vehicles and accelerating robotic design processes. At Microsoft Research and Themis AI, she works on creating uncertainty-aware frameworks for deep learning, which has impacts across computational biology, language modeling, and robotics. She has presented her work at the Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) conference and the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of research, Lolla leads initiatives to make computer science education more accessible globally. She is an instructor for class 6.s191 (MIT Introduction to Deep Learning), one of the largest AI courses in the world, which reaches millions of students annually. She serves as the curriculum lead for Momentum AI, the only U.S. program that teaches AI to underserved students for free, and she has taught hundreds of students in Northern Scotland as part of the MIT Global Teaching Labs program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lolla was also the director for xFair, MIT’s largest student-run career fair, and is an executive board member for Next Sing, where she works to make a cappella more accessible for students across musical backgrounds.&amp;nbsp;In her free time, she enjoys singing, solving crossword puzzles, and baking.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Automated method helps researchers quantify uncertainty in their predictions</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pollsters trying to predict presidential election results and physicists searching for distant exoplanets have at least one thing in common: They often use a tried-and-true scientific technique called Bayesian inference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bayesian inference allows these scientists to effectively estimate some unknown parameter — like the winner of an election — from data such as poll results. But Bayesian inference can be slow, sometimes consuming weeks or even months of computation time or requiring a researcher to spend hours deriving tedious equations by hand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers from MIT and elsewhere have introduced an optimization technique that speeds things up without requiring a scientist to do a lot of additional work. Their method can achieve more accurate results faster than another popular approach for accelerating Bayesian inference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this new automated technique, a scientist could simply input their model and then the optimization method does all the calculations under the hood to provide an approximation of some unknown parameter. The method also offers reliable uncertainty estimates that can help a researcher understand when to trust its predictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This versatile technique could be applied to a wide array of scientific quandaries that incorporate Bayesian inference. For instance, it could be used by economists studying the impact of microcredit loans in developing nations or sports analysts using a model to rank top tennis players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When you actually dig into what people are doing in the social sciences, physics, chemistry, or biology, they are often using a lot of the same tools under the hood. There are so many Bayesian analyses out there. If we can build a really great tool that makes these researchers lives easier, then we can really make a difference to a lot of people in many different research areas,” says senior author Tamara Broderick, an associate professor in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and a member of the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems and the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broderick is joined on the paper by co-lead authors Ryan Giordano, an assistant professor of statistics at the University of California at Berkeley; and Martin Ingram, a data scientist at the AI company KONUX. The paper was recently &lt;a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/volume25/23-1015/23-1015.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Machine Learning Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When researchers seek a faster form of Bayesian inference, they often turn to a technique called automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI), which is often both fast to run and easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Broderick and her collaborators have found a number of practical issues with ADVI. It has to solve an optimization problem and can do so only approximately. So, ADVI can still require a lot of computation time and user effort to determine whether the approximate solution is good enough. And once it arrives at a solution, it tends to provide poor uncertainty estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than reinventing the wheel, the team took many ideas from ADVI but turned them around to create a technique called deterministic ADVI (DADVI) that doesn’t have these downsides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With DADVI, it is very clear when the optimization is finished, so a user won’t need to spend extra computation time to ensure that the best solution has been found. DADVI also permits the incorporation of more powerful optimization methods that give it an additional speed and performance boost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once it reaches a result, DADVI is set up to allow the use of uncertainty corrections. These corrections make its uncertainty estimates much more accurate than those of ADVI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DADVI also enables the user to clearly see how much error they have incurred in the approximation to the optimization problem. This prevents a user from needlessly running the optimization again and again with more and more resources to try and reduce the error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to see if we could live up to the promise of black-box inference in the sense of, once the user makes their model, they can just run Bayesian inference and don’t have to derive everything by hand, they don’t need to figure out when to stop their algorithm, and they have a sense of how accurate their approximate solution is,” Broderick says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defying conventional wisdom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DADVI can be more effective than ADVI because it uses an efficient approximation method, called sample average approximation, which estimates an unknown quantity by taking a series of exact steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the steps along the way are exact, it is clear when the objective has been reached. Plus, getting to that objective typically requires fewer steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, researchers expect sample average approximation to be more computationally intensive than a more popular method, known as stochastic gradient, which is used by ADVI. But Broderick and her collaborators showed that, in many applications, this is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A lot of problems really do have special structure, and you can be so much more efficient and get better performance by taking advantage of that special structure. That is something we have really seen in this paper,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They tested DADVI on a number of real-world models and datasets, including a model used by economists to evaluate the effectiveness of microcredit loans and one used in ecology to determine whether a species is present at a particular site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the board, they found that DADVI can estimate unknown parameters faster and more reliably than other methods, and achieves as good or better accuracy than ADVI. Because it is easier to use than other techniques, DADVI could offer a boost to scientists in a wide variety of fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, the researchers want to dig deeper into correction methods for uncertainty estimates so they can better understand why these corrections can produce such accurate uncertainties, and when they could fall short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In applied statistics, we often have to use approximate algorithms for problems that are too complex or high-dimensional to allow exact solutions to be computed in reasonable time. This new paper offers an interesting set of theory and empirical results that point to an improvement in a popular existing approximate algorithm for Bayesian inference,” says Andrew Gelman ’85, ’86, a professor of statistics and political science at Columbia University, who was not involved with the study. “As one of the team involved in the creation of that earlier work, I'm happy to see our algorithm superseded by something more stable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research was supported by a National Science Foundation CAREER Award and the U.S. Office of Naval Research.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

  <description><![CDATA[MIT researchers propose “PEDS” method for developing models of complex physical systems in mechanics, optics, thermal transport, fluid dynamics, physical chemistry, climate, and more.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Sandi Miller | Department of Mathematics</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In fields such as physics and engineering, partial differential equations (PDEs) are used to model complex physical processes to generate insight into how some of the most complicated physical and natural systems in the world function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve these difficult equations, researchers use high-fidelity numerical solvers, which can be very time-consuming and computationally expensive to run. The current simplified alternative, data-driven surrogate models, compute the goal property of a solution to PDEs rather than the whole solution. Those are trained on a set of data that has been generated by the high-fidelity solver, to predict the output of the PDEs for new inputs. This is data-intensive and expensive because complex physical systems require a large number of simulations to generate enough data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a new paper, “&lt;a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/153164" target="_blank"&gt;Physics-enhanced deep surrogates for partial differential equations&lt;/a&gt;,” published in December in &lt;em&gt;Nature Machine Intelligence&lt;/em&gt;, a new method is proposed&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;for developing data-driven surrogate models for complex physical systems in such fields as mechanics, optics, thermal transport, fluid dynamics, physical chemistry, and climate models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper was authored by MIT’s professor of applied mathematics &lt;a href="https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/people/steven-johnson/"&gt;Steven G. Johnson&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href="https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-daspa"&gt;Payel Das&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/people/youssef-mroueh/"&gt;Youssef Mroueh&lt;/a&gt; of the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab and IBM Research; &lt;a href="https://chrisrackauckas.com/"&gt;Chris Rackauckas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://julia.mit.edu/"&gt;Julia Lab&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href="http://www.raphaelpestourie.com"&gt;Raphaël Pestourie&lt;/a&gt;, a former MIT postdoc who is now at Georgia Tech. The authors call their method "physics-enhanced deep surrogate" (PEDS), which combines a low-fidelity, explainable physics simulator with a neural network generator. The neural network generator is trained end-to-end to match the output of the high-fidelity numerical solver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My aspiration is to replace the inefficient process of trial and error with systematic, computer-aided simulation and optimization,” says Pestourie. “Recent breakthroughs in AI like the large language model of ChatGPT rely on hundreds of billions of parameters and require vast amounts of resources to train and evaluate. In contrast, PEDS is affordable to all because it is incredibly efficient in computing resources and has a very low barrier in terms of infrastructure needed to use it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the article, they show that PEDS surrogates can be up to three times more accurate than an ensemble of feedforward neural networks with limited data (approximately 1,000 training points), and reduce the training data needed by at least a factor of 100 to achieve a target error of 5 percent. Developed using the MIT-designed &lt;a href="https://julialang.org/"&gt;Julia programming language&lt;/a&gt;, this scientific machine-learning method is thus efficient in both computing and data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors also report that PEDS provides a general, data-driven strategy to bridge the gap between a vast array of simplified physical models with corresponding brute-force numerical solvers modeling complex systems. This technique offers accuracy, speed, data efficiency, and physical insights into the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Says Pestourie, “Since the 2000s, as computing capabilities improved, the trend of scientific models has been to increase the number of parameters to fit the data better, sometimes at the cost of a lower predictive accuracy. PEDS does the opposite by choosing its parameters smartly. It leverages the technology of automatic differentiation to train a neural network that makes a model with few parameters accurate.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The main challenge that prevents surrogate models from being used more widely in engineering is the curse of dimensionality&amp;nbsp;— the fact that the needed data to train a model increases exponentially with the number of model variables,” says Pestourie. “PEDS reduces this curse by incorporating information from the data and from the field knowledge in the form of a low-fidelity model solver.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers say that PEDS has the potential to revive a whole body of the pre-2000 literature dedicated to minimal models — intuitive models that PEDS could make more accurate while also being predictive for surrogate model applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The application of the PEDS framework is beyond what we showed in this study,” says Das. “Complex physical systems governed by PDEs are ubiquitous, from climate modeling to seismic modeling and beyond. Our physics-inspired fast and explainable surrogate models will be of great use in those applications, and play a complementary role to other emerging techniques, like foundation models."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was supported by the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab and the U.S. Army Research Office through the Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>A flexible solution to help artists improve animation</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Artists who bring to life heroes and villains in animated movies and video games could have more control over their animations, thanks to a new technique introduced by MIT researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their method generates mathematical functions known as barycentric coordinates, which define how 2D and 3D shapes can bend, stretch, and move through space. For example, an artist using their tool could choose functions that make the motions of a 3D cat’s tail fit their vision for the “look” of the animated feline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Animation of blue cat enclosed in mesh, as its tail curls side to side." data-align="center" data-caption="This gif shows how researchers used their technique to provide a smoother motion for a cat’s tail.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many other techniques for this problem are inflexible, providing only a single option for the barycentric coordinate functions for a certain animated character. Each function may or may not be the best one for a particular animation. The artist would have to start from scratch with a new approach each time they want to try for a slightly different look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As researchers, we can sometimes get stuck in a loop of solving artistic problems without consulting with artists. What artists care about is flexibility and the ‘look’ of their final product. They don’t care about the partial differential equations your algorithm solves behind the scenes,” says Ana Dodik, lead author of a paper on this technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond its artistic applications, this technique could be used in areas such as medical imaging, architecture, virtual reality, and even in computer vision as a tool to help robots figure out how objects move in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dodik, an electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) graduate student, wrote the paper with Oded Stein, assistant professor at the University of Southern California’s Viterbi School of Engineering; Vincent Sitzmann, assistant professor of EECS who leads the Scene Representation Group in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL); and senior author Justin Solomon, an associate professor of EECS and leader of the CSAIL Geometric Data Processing Group. The research was recently presented at SIGGRAPH Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A generalized approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When an artist animates a 2D or 3D character, one common technique is to surround the complex shape of the character with a simpler set of points connected by line segments or triangles, called a cage. The animator drags these points to move and deform the character inside the cage. The key technical problem is to determine how the character moves when the cage is modified; this motion is determined by the design of a particular barycentric coordinate function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional approaches use complicated equations to find cage-based motions that are extremely smooth, avoiding kinks that could develop in a shape when it is stretched or bent to the extreme. But there are many notions of how the artistic idea of “smoothness” translates into math, each of which leads to a different set of barycentric coordinate functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MIT researchers sought a general approach that allows artists to have a say in designing or choosing among smoothness energies for any shape. Then the artist could preview the deformation and choose the smoothness energy that looks the best to their taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although flexible design of barycentric coordinates is a modern idea, the basic mathematical construction of barycentric coordinates dates back centuries. Introduced by the German mathematician August Möbius in 1827, barycentric coordinates dictate how each corner of a shape exerts influence over the shape’s interior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a triangle, which is the shape Möbius used in his calculations, barycentric coordinates are easy to design — but when the cage isn’t a triangle, the calculations become messy. Making barycentric coordinates for a complicated cage is especially difficult because, for complex shapes, each barycentric coordinate must meet a set of constraints while being as smooth as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diverging from past work, the team used a special type of neural network to model the unknown barycentric coordinate functions. A neural network, loosely based on the human brain, processes an input using many layers of interconnected nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While neural networks are often applied in AI applications that mimic human thought, in this project neural networks are used for a mathematical reason. The researchers’ network architecture knows how to output barycentric coordinate functions that satisfy all the constraints exactly. They build the constraints directly into the network, so when it generates solutions, they are always valid. This construction helps artists design interesting barycentric coordinates without having to worry about mathematical aspects of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The tricky part was building in the constraints. Standard tools didn’t get us all the way there, so we really had to think outside the box,” Dodik says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virtual triangles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers drew on the triangular barycentric coordinates Möbius introduced nearly 200 years ago. These triangular coordinates are simple to compute and satisfy all the necessary constraints, but modern cages are much more complex than triangles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To bridge the gap, the researchers’ method covers a shape with overlapping virtual triangles that connect triplets of points on the outside of the cage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Each virtual triangle defines a valid barycentric coordinate function. We just need a way of combining them,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is where the neural network comes in. It predicts how to combine the virtual triangles’ barycentric coordinates to make a more complicated, but smooth function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using their method, an artist could try one function, look at the final animation, and then tweak the coordinates to generate different motions until they arrive at an animation that looks the way they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“From a practical perspective, I think the biggest impact is that neural networks give you a lot of flexibility that you didn’t previously have,” Dodik says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers demonstrated how their method could generate more natural-looking animations than other approaches, like a cat’s tail that curves smoothly when it moves instead of folding rigidly near the vertices of the cage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, they want to try different strategies to accelerate the neural network. They also want to build this method into an interactive interface that would enable an artist to easily iterate on animations in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research was funded, in part, by the U.S. Army Research Office, the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the U.S. National Science Foundation, the CSAIL Systems that Learn Program, the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, the Toyota-CSAIL Joint Research Center, Adobe Systems, a Google Research Award, the Singapore Defense Science and Technology Agency, and the Amazon Science Hub.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>MIT researchers observe a hallmark quantum behavior in bouncing droplets</title>

  <description><![CDATA[In a study that could help fill some holes in quantum theory, the team recreated a “quantum bomb tester” in a classical droplet test.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p class="Body"&gt;In our everyday classical world, what you see is what you get. A ball is just a ball, and when lobbed through the air, its trajectory is straightforward and clear. But if that ball were shrunk to the size of an atom or smaller, its behavior would shift into a quantum, fuzzy reality. The ball would exist as not just a physical particle but also a wave of possible particle states. And this wave-particle duality can give rise to some weird and sneaky phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Body"&gt;One of the stranger prospects comes from a thought experiment known as the “quantum bomb tester.” The experiment proposes that a quantum particle, such as a photon, could act as a sort of telekinetic bomb detector. Through its properties as both a particle and a wave, the photon could, in theory, sense the presence of a bomb without physically interacting with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Animation of droplet waves rippling against the bomb as it comes out from underground looped tunnel. The bomb explodes when waves pass though it." data-align="center" data-caption="When a representative “bomb” is placed in one corridor of the experiment, and the droplet bounces through the other corridor, the droplet’s waves ripple against the bomb, causing the droplet to veer away. The effect as if the droplet “sensed” the bomb, without physically interacting with it. This classical effect is similar to what is predicted in the “quantum bomb test.” When the droplet bounces through the corridor with the bomb, it predictably explodes.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;

&lt;p class="Body"&gt;The concept checks out mathematically and is in line with what the equations governing quantum mechanics allow. But when it comes to spelling out exactly how a particle would accomplish such a bomb-sniffing feat, physicists are stumped. The conundrum lies in a quantum particle’s inherently shifty, in-between, undefinable state. In other words, scientists just have to trust that it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Body"&gt;But mathematicians at MIT are hoping to dispel some of the mystery and ultimately establish a more concrete picture of quantum mechanics. They have now shown that they can recreate an analog of the quantum bomb tester and generate the behavior that the experiment predicts. They’ve done so not in an exotic, microscopic, quantum setting, but in a seemingly mundane, classical, tabletop setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Body"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/153144" target="_blank"&gt;paper appearing today&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Physical Review A&lt;/em&gt;, the team reports recreating the quantum bomb tester in an experiment with a study of bouncing droplets. The team found that the interaction of the droplet with its own waves is similar to a photon’s quantum wave-particle behavior: When dropped into a configuration similar to what is proposed in the quantum bomb test, the droplet behaves in exactly the same statistical manner that is predicted for the photon. If there were actually a bomb in the setup 50 percent of the time, the droplet, like the photon, would detect it, without physically interacting with it, 25 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Body"&gt;The fact that the statistics in both experiments match up suggests that something in the droplet’s classical dynamics may be at the heart of a photon’s otherwise mysterious quantum behavior. The researchers see the study as another bridge between two realities: the observable, classical world and the fuzzier quantum realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Body"&gt;“Here we have a classical system that gives the same statistics as arises in the quantum bomb test, which is considered one of the wonders of the quantum world,” says study author John Bush, professor of applied mathematics at MIT. “In fact, we find that the phenomenon is not so wonderful after all. And this is another example of quantum behavior that can be understood from a local realist&amp;nbsp;perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Body"&gt;Bush’s co-author is former MIT postdoc Valeri Frumkin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Body"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making waves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Body"&gt;To some physicists, quantum mechanics leaves too much to the imagination and doesn’t say enough about the actual dynamics from which such weird phenomena supposedly arise. In 1927, in an attempt to crystallize quantum mechanics, physicist Louis de Broglie presented the pilot wave theory — a still-controversial idea that poses a particle’s quantum behavior is determined not by an intangible, statistical wave of possible states but by a physical “pilot” wave of its own making, that guides the particle through space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Body"&gt;The concept was mostly discounted until 2005, when physicist Yves Couder discovered that de Broglie’s quantum waves could be replicated and studied in a classical, fluid-based experiment. The setup involves a bath of fluid that is made to subtly vibrate up and down, though not quite enough to generate waves on its own. A millimeter-sized droplet of the same fluid is then dispensed over the bath, and as it bounces off the surface, the droplet resonates with the bath’s vibrations, creating what physicists know as a standing wave field that “pilots,” or pushes the droplet along. The effect is of a droplet that appears to walk along a rippled surface in patterns that turn out to be in line with de Broglie’s pilot wave theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Body"&gt;For the last 13 years, Bush has worked to refine and extend Couder’s hydrodynamic pilot wave experiments and has successfully used the setup to observe droplets exhibiting emergent, quantum-like behavior, including quantum tunneling, single-particle diffraction, and surreal trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Body"&gt;“It turns out that this hydrodynamic pilot-wave experiment exhibits many features of quantum systems which were previously thought to be impossible to understand from a classical perspective,” Bush says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Body"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bombs away&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Body"&gt;In their new study, he and Frumkin took on the quantum bomb tester. The thought experiment begins with a conceptual interferometer — essentially, two corridors of the same length that branch out from the same starting point, then turn and converge, forming a rhombus-like configuration as the corridors continue on, each ending in a respective detector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Body"&gt;According to quantum mechanics, if a photon is fired from the interferometer’s starting point, through a beamsplitter, the particle should travel down one of the two corridors with equal probability. Meanwhile, the photon’s mysterious “wave function,” or the sum of all its possible states, travels down both corridors simultaneously. The wave function interferes in such a way to ensure that the particle only appears at one detector (let’s call this D1) and never the other (D2). Hence, the photon should be detected at D1 100 percent of the time, regardless of which corridor it traveled through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Body"&gt;If there is a bomb in one of the two corridors, and a photon heads down this corridor, it predictably triggers the bomb and the setup is blown to bits, and no photon is detected at either detector. But if the photon travels down the corridor without the bomb, something weird happens: Its wave function, in traveling down both corridors, is cut short in one by the bomb. As it’s not quite a particle, the wave does not set off the bomb. But the wave interference is altered in such a way that the particle will be detected with equal probability at D1 and D2. Any signal at D2 therefore would mean that a photon has detected the presence of the bomb, without physically interacting with it. If the bomb is present 50 percent of the time, then this weird quantum bomb detection should occur 25 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Body"&gt;In their new study, Bush and Frumkin set up an analogous experiment to see if this quantum behavior could emerge in classical droplets. Into a bath of silicon oil, they submerged a structure similar to the rhombus-like corridors in the thought experiment. They then carefully dispensed tiny oil droplets into the bath and tracked their paths. They added a structure to one side of the rhombus to mimic a bomb-like object and observed how the droplet and its wave patterns changed in response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Body"&gt;In the end, they found that 25 percent of the time a droplet bounced through the corridor without the “bomb,” while its pilot waves interacted with the bomb structure in a way that pushed the droplet away from the bomb. From this perspective, the droplet was able to “sense” the bomb-like object without physically coming into contact with it. While the droplet exhibited quantum-like behavior, the team could plainly see that this behavior emerged from the droplet’s waves, which physically helped to keep the droplet away from the bomb. These dynamics, the team says, may also help to explain the mysterious behavior in quantum particles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Body"&gt;“Not only are the statistics the same, but we also know the dynamics, which was a mystery,” Frumkin says. “And the inference is that an analogous dynamics may underly the quantum behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Body"&gt;"This system is the only example we know which is not quantum but shares some strong wave-particles properties," says theoretical physicist Matthieu Labousse, of ESPCI Paris, who was not involved in the study. "It is very surprising that many examples thought to be peculiar to the quantum world can be reproduced by such a classical system. It enables to understand the barrier between what it is specific to a quantum system and what is not.&amp;nbsp; The latest results of the group at MIT pushes the barrier very far."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Body"&gt;This research is supported, in part, by the National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Anushree Chaudhuri and Rupert Li have won Marshall Scholarships, a prestigious British government-funded fellowship that offers exceptional American students the opportunity to pursue several years of graduate study in any field at any university in the United Kingdom. Up to 50 scholarships are awarded each year by the Marshall Aid Commemoration Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The students were advised and supported by the distinguished fellowships team, led by Associate Dean Kim Benard in Career Advising and Professional Development. They also received mentorship from the Presidential Committee on Distinguished Fellowships, co-chaired by professors Will Broadhead and Nancy Kanwisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The MIT students who applied for this year's Marshall Scholarship embody that combination of intellectual prowess, hard work, and civic-mindedness that characterizes the Institute at its best,” says Broadhead. “These students are truly amazing! The thoughtfulness and optimism they demonstrated throughout the months-long exercise in critical reflection and personal growth that the application process demands impressed and inspired us all. On behalf of the Distinguished Fellowships Committee, Nancy and I are thrilled to extend our warmest congratulations to Anushree and Rupert and our very best wishes as they take their richly deserved places in the Marshall Scholar community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anushree Chaudhuri&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anushree Chaudhuri from San Diego, California, will graduate next spring with bachelor’s degrees in urban studies and planning and economics and a master's in city planning. As a Marshall Scholar, she plans to pursue a PhD related to energy, environment, and development at the University of Cambridge. In the future, Chaudhuri hopes to work across the public and private sectors to drive structural changes that connect global environmental challenges to local community contexts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since 2021, Chaudhuri has worked with Professor Larry Susskind in the Science Impact Collaborative to study local responses to large-scale renewable energy projects. This past summer, she traveled around California to document the experiences of rural and Indigenous communities most directly affected by energy transitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chaudhuri has also worked with the U.S. Department of Energy, the World Wildlife Fund, and an environmental, social, and governance investing startup, as well as with several groups at MIT including the Office of Sustainability, Environmental Solutions Initiative, and the Climate and Sustainability Consortium. She represented MIT as an undergraduate delegate to the United Nations COP27.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On campus, Chaudhuri co-leads the Student Sustainability Coalition, an umbrella organization for student sustainability groups. She has previously served as chair of Undergraduate Association Sustainability; a co-lead of the student campaign to revise MIT’s Fast Forward Climate Action Plan; judicial chair of Burton-Conner House; and as a representative on several campus committees, including the Corporation Joint Advisory Committee. She also loves to sing and write.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2023, Chaudhuri was named a Udall Scholar and an MIT Burchard Scholar. By taking an interdisciplinary approach that combines law, planning, economics, participatory research, and data science, she is committed to a public service career addressing social and climate injustices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rupert Li&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hailing from Portland, Oregon, Rupert Li is a concurrent senior and master’s student at MIT. He will graduate in May 2024 with a BS in mathematics, a BS in computer science, economics, and data science, and a minor in business analytics. He will also be awarded an MEng in computer science, economics, and data science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a graduate student in the U.K., Li will pursue the MASt degree in pure mathematics at Cambridge University, followed by the MSc in mathematics and foundations of computer science at Oxford University. Li aspires to become a professor of mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Li has written 10 math research articles, primarily in combinatorics, but also including discrete geometry, probability, and harmonic analysis. Since his first-year fall, he has worked with Adjunct Professor Henry Cohn in the MIT Department of Mathematics and has authored two papers based on this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Li works on sphere-packing and coding theory, a famously challenging mathematical problem that has applications in error-correcting codes, which are ubiquitously used in the digital age to protect against data corruption. He currently also works with Professor Nike Sun in the MIT math department on probability theory and Professor Jim Propp of the University of Massachusetts at Lowell on enumerative combinatorics and statistical mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Li has worked as a course designer and teaching assistant for Professor Jim Orlin of the MIT Sloan School of Management and Professor Muhamet Yildiz in the Department of Economics, and is currently head teaching assistant for class 6.7900 (Machine Learning). Li received the Barry Goldwater Scholarship and a Morgan Prize Honorable Mention for his undergraduate research. In his free time, he enjoys watching movies and playing strategy games with friends.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two MIT faculty were recently honored by &lt;a href="https://www.schmidtfutures.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Schmidt Futures&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;a philanthropic initiative of Eric and Wendy Schmidt. MathWorks Professor &lt;a href="https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=1498"&gt;Jörn Dunkel&lt;/a&gt; received the 2023 &lt;a href="https://www.schmidtfutures.com/our-work/schmidt-science-polymaths/" target="_blank"&gt;Schmidt Science Polymath&lt;/a&gt; award, and professor of computational cognitive science &lt;a href="https://ai2050.schmidtfutures.com/fellow/josh-tenenbaum/"&gt;Josh Tenenbaum&lt;/a&gt; was named a Schmidt Futures &lt;a href="https://www.schmidtfutures.com/second-cohort-of-ai2050-senior-fellows-named-by-schmidt-futures/" target="_blank"&gt;AI2050 Senior Fellow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also winning a Schmidt Science Polymath award was &lt;a href="https://ganguli-gang.stanford.edu/"&gt;Surya Ganguli&lt;/a&gt; ’98, MNG ’98, who is an associate professor at Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Science Polymaths&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dunkel is part of a select group of nine distinguished scientists who this year join the existing network of Schmidt Science Polymaths, awarded to recently tenured professors with remarkable track records&amp;nbsp;doing interdisciplinary research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Schmidt Futures Initiative awards $500,000 per year for up to five years to support innovative, highly interdisciplinary research by recently tenured professors with remarkable track records, promising futures, and a desire to explore interdisciplinary research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dunkel’s current research studies self-organization processes in complex biological and physical systems across a wide range of scales, from bacterial biofilms&amp;nbsp;and embryonic tissues to brain dynamics and global trade networks. In collaboration with their experimental partner labs at&amp;nbsp;MIT, his group is developing and&amp;nbsp;investigating mathematical models that describe and predict the emergent dynamical behaviors of multicellular and multi-organismal communities. By analyzing the&amp;nbsp;structure of the underlying model equations, Dunkel seeks ways to bridge seemingly&amp;nbsp;disparate systems through the “common language” of math.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I would like to express my profound thanks to the Schmidt Futures Initiative for this generous award, which gives us the freedom to explore new research directions,”&amp;nbsp;says Dunkel. “I am particularly grateful for the encouragement to pursue interdisciplinary projects that aim to challenge prevalent paradigms by integrating state-of-the-art&amp;nbsp;data acquisition with new mathematical approaches. And a big thank you to my PhD students and postdocs and our collaborators whose exceptional&amp;nbsp;work is recognized through this award.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surya Ganguli was a triple undergraduate MIT major in electrical engineering and computer science, physics, and mathematics. Now as an associate professor of applied physics at Stanford, he leads the Neural Dynamics and Computation Lab and has been a visiting researcher at both Google and Meta AI. His research spans the fields of neuroscience, machine learning, and physics, focusing on understanding and improving how both biological and artificial neural networks learn striking emergent computations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI2050 Senior Fellow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josh Tenenbaum, a professor in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences who pursues research in computational cognitive science, was selected as a 2023 Schmidt Futures AI2050 Senior Fellow. He holds appointments in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and the Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines (CBMM), and serves as Director of Science for the MIT Quest for Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tenenbaum &lt;a href="https://bcs.mit.edu/news/bcs-professor-josh-tenenbaum-named-schmidt-futures-ai2050-senior-fellow"&gt;will pursue interdisciplinary research&lt;/a&gt; in artificial intelligence to help chart the development of AI for societal benefit. As a senior fellow, Tenenbaum’s long-term goal is to reverse-engineer intelligence in the human mind and brain, and use these insights to engineer more human-like machine intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI2050 has allocated up to $7 million to support the new Senior Fellows’ research to address “hard problems” in AI in their respective fields including computer science, chemistry, cognitive science, the arts, and philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tenenbaum is best known for theories of cognition as Bayesian inference, with a focus on explaining how humans can learn so much so quickly, from so little data. In AI, he has developed influential approaches to dimensionality reduction, unsupervised learning and structure discovery, and probabilistic programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His current research focuses on probabilistic program models of common sense in humans and machines, grounding language and perception in these representations, and learning based on program synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://aps.org/programs/honors/listings.cfm"&gt;American Physical Society&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(APS) recently honored five MIT community members for their contributions to physics: Professor Wit Busza, Instructor&amp;nbsp;Karol Bacik,&amp;nbsp;postdocs Cari Cesarotti and Chao Li, and Pablo Gaston Debenedetti SM ’81, PhD ’85.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom W. Bonner Prize in Nuclear Physics &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/wit-busza/"&gt;Wit Busza&lt;/a&gt;, the Francis L. Friedman Professor of Physics Emeritus, and a researcher in the &lt;a href="https://web.mit.edu/lns/"&gt;Laboratory for Nuclear Science&lt;/a&gt;, was awarded the &lt;a href="https://aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/bonner.cfm"&gt;Tom W. Bonner Prize in Nuclear Physics&lt;/a&gt; “for pioneering work on multi-particle production in proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions, including the discovery of participant scaling, and for the conception and leadership of the PHOBOS experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prize recognizes&amp;nbsp;outstanding experimental research in nuclear physics, including the development of a method, technique, or device that significantly contributes to nuclear physics research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When two protons or nuclei traveling at close to the speed of light collide, a vast number of particles are created. It is a distinct&amp;nbsp;example of energy&amp;nbsp;converting to mass. As an example, when lead nuclei collide in the highest-energy colliders, one often sees&amp;nbsp;over 10,000 protons, neutrons, antiprotons, pi-mesons, etc. streaming out from the tiny volume where the collision took place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It's amazing if you consider that this&amp;nbsp;volume is no larger than that of a mere 100 or so of such particles,” Busza says.&amp;nbsp;“The question arises: What exactly is this extremely hot (more than a billion times higher temperature than the surface of the sun) and super dense stuff, which was produced in the collision, before it evolved into the observed large number of created particles? It is a particularly interesting question since we think it is the same stuff, named the quark-gluon plasma, out of which most of our universe was made at about 10 microseconds after the Big Bang.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Busza is best known for influential pA experiments at Fermilab, in which he discovered participant scaling and obtained, together with Alfred Goldhaber, the first data-based estimate of the energy density that will be produced in the future Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). He’s also known for originating and leading the PHOBOS experiment, which together with the other RHIC experiments discovered a strongly interacting quantum chromodynamics liquid (at the time named “strongly interacting Quark-Gluon Plasma”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andreas Acrivos Dissertation Award in Fluid Dynamics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instructor of applied mathematics &lt;a href="https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=2574"&gt;Karol Bacik&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;received the American Physical Society’s 2023&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/acrivos.cfm"&gt;Andreas Acrivos Dissertation Award in Fluid Dynamics&lt;/a&gt; “for an elegant study of dune-dune repulsion and dune-obstacle interaction using laboratory experiments, data analysis, and mathematical modeling, elucidating the intricate feedback between sediment dynamics and fluid mechanics.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His groundbreaking experimental and theoretical work on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.054501"&gt;dynamics of underwater&amp;nbsp;sand dunes&lt;/a&gt; was done at the University of Cambridge, where he received his PhD in 2021. From 2021-23 Bacik was a research associate at the University of Bath, where he investigated a range of problems in active flows and mathematical biology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bacik’s award&amp;nbsp;lecture will be at the &lt;a href="https://www.2023apsdfd.org/"&gt;76th Annual Meeting of the APS Division of Fluid Dynamics&lt;/a&gt; on Nov. 21.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J.J. and Noriko Sakurai Dissertation Award in Theoretical Particle Physics &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/prizerecipient.cfm?last_nm=Cesarotti&amp;amp;first_nm=Cari&amp;amp;year=2023"&gt;Cari Cesarotti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,&amp;nbsp;a postdoc at the Center for Theoretical Physics, received the&amp;nbsp;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/prizerecipient.cfm?last_nm=Cesarotti&amp;amp;first_nm=Cari&amp;amp;year=2023"&gt;2023&amp;nbsp;J.J. and Noriko Sakurai Dissertation Award in Theoretical Particle Physics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; “for exploration of collider signals of physics beyond the Standard Model, including the development and assessment of a novel collider event-shape observable tailored for distinguishing strongly coupled hidden sectors from background, and studies of physics at future muon accelerators and colliders.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cesarotti’s research program works toward discovering physics beyond the Standard Model in robust ways.&amp;nbsp;This includes developing novel observables, model-building new physics scenarios, and&amp;nbsp;advancing the physics case for future experiments. She is also an active member of the muon collider community. Cesarotti completed her BA in physics at Cornell University in 2017, and completed her dissertation in high-energy particle theory under Professor Matthew Reece at Harvard University in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outstanding Doctoral Thesis Research in Beam Physics Award&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE) postdoc &lt;a href="https://qp.mit.edu/people/"&gt;Chao Li&lt;/a&gt; received the &lt;a href="https://aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/prizerecipient.cfm?last_nm=Li&amp;amp;first_nm=Chao&amp;amp;year=2023"&gt;2023 Outstanding Doctoral Thesis Research in Beam Physics Award&lt;/a&gt; “for seminal and highly creative contributions to the development of microfabricated, miniature atomic beam technology and the invention of new chip-scale techniques that enable precise and targeted delivery of neutral atoms.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With MIT RLE’s Quantum Photonics and AI Group, Li is exploring the use of large-scale photonic integrated circuits for the fast and coherent control of various types of qubits, such as color centers in diamonds, trapped neutral atoms, and ions. Li earned his bachelor’s degree from Jilin University in 2016, and his PhD from Georgia Tech in 2022, both in physics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aneesur Rahman Prize for Computational Physics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pablo Gaston Debenedetti SM ’81, PhD ’85, an alumnus of the MIT Department of Chemical Engineering who is currently the&amp;nbsp;Princeton University dean for research, received the 2023 &lt;a href="https://www.aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/rahman.cfm"&gt;Aneesur Rahman Prize for Computational Physics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;“for seminal contributions to the science of supercooled liquids and glasses, water, and aqueous solutions, through ground-breaking simulations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debenedetti’s research interests include supercooled water, glasses, protein thermodynamics, nucleation, metastability, the origin of biological homochirality, and hydrophobicity. His most important results, obtained with students and collaborators, include providing rigorous computational proof of the existence of a liquid-liquid transition in several water models, and demonstrating the relationship between structural order and water’s anomalies.&lt;/p&gt;

  <description><![CDATA[Senior Joshua Kuffour has set a goal of taking classes in as many departments as he can before he graduates. “It's taught me about valuing different ways of thinking,” he says.]]></description>
  <pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2023/joshua-kuffour-power-of-knowledge-1113</guid>
        <dc:creator>Angelina Parrillo | MIT News correspondent</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In his early career at MIT, Josh Kuffour’s academic interests spanned mathematics, engineering, and physics. He decided to major in chemical engineering, figuring it would draw on all three areas. Then, he found himself increasingly interested in the mathematical components of his studies and added a second major, applied mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, with a double major and energy studies minor, Kuffour is still seeking to learn even more. He has made it a goal to take classes from as many different departments as he can before he graduates. So far, he has taken classes from 17 different departments, ranging from Civil and Environmental Engineering to Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences to Linguistics and Philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s taught me about valuing different ways of thinking,” he says about this wide-ranging approach to the course catalog. “It’s also taught me to value blending disciplines as a whole. Learning about how other people think about the same problems from different perspectives allows for better solutions to be developed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After graduation, Kuffour plans to pursue a master’s degree at MIT, either in the Technology and Policy Program or in the Department of Chemical Engineering. He intends to make renewable energy, and its role in addressing societal inequalities, the focus of his career after graduating, and eventually plans to become a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serving the public&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the power of knowledge, Kuffour says he enjoys helping to educate others “in any way I can.” He is involved with several extracurriculars in which he can be a mentor for both peers and high school students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kuffour has volunteered with the Educational Studies Program since his first semester at MIT. This club runs &lt;a href="https://pk12.mit.edu/activities/splash/"&gt;Splash&lt;/a&gt;, “a weekend-long learning extravaganza,” as Kuffour puts it, in which MIT students teach over 400 free classes on a huge variety of topics for local high school students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For his peers, Kuffour also participates in the &lt;a href="https://gelp.mit.edu/"&gt;Gordon Engineering Leadership Program&lt;/a&gt; (GEL). Here, he teaches first-year GEL students leadership skills that engineers may require in their future careers. In doing this, Kuffour says he develops his own leadership skills as well. He is also working as a teaching assistant for multivariable calculus this semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kuffour has also served as an advisor for the &lt;a href="http://concourse.mit.edu/"&gt;Concourse&lt;/a&gt; learning community; as president of his fraternity, &lt;a href="https://www.beta.mit.edu/"&gt;Beta Theta Pi&lt;/a&gt;; as a student representative on the &lt;a href="https://firstyear.mit.edu/academics-exploration/general-institute-requirements-girs/humanities-arts-and-social-sciences-hass-requirement/"&gt;HASS requirement&lt;/a&gt; subcommittee; and as a publicist for the &lt;a href="https://www.reasoningforgod.com/"&gt;Reason for God&lt;/a&gt; series, which invites the MIT community to discuss the intersections of religion with various facets of human life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renewable energy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kuffour’s interest in energy issues has grown and evolved in recent years. He first learned about the ecological condition of the world in the eighth grade after watching the climate change documentary “Earth 2100” in school. Going into high school and college, Kuffour says he started reading books, taking classes, watching documentaries, participating in beach and city clean ups, to learn as much as possible about the environment and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the summer of 2023, Kuffour worked as an energy and climate analysis intern for the consulting company Keylogic and has continued helping the company shift programming languages to Python for evaluating the economics of different methods of decarbonizing electricity sectors in the U.S. He has also assisted in analyzing trends in U.S. natural gas imports, exports, production, and consumption since the early 2000s. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his time as an undergraduate, Kuffour’s interest in renewable energy has taken on a more justice-focused perspective. He’s learned over the course of his that due to historical inequalities in the U.S., pollution and other environmental problems have disproportionately impacted people of lower economic status and people of color. Since global warming will exacerbate these impacts, Kuffour seeks to address these growing inequalities through his work in energy data analysis.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translating interests into activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kuffour’s pursuit to expand his worldview never rests, even outside of the classroom. In his free time, he enjoys listening to podcasts or watching documentaries on any subject. When attempting to list all his favorite podcasts, he cuts himself off, saying, “This could go on for a while.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Kuffour participated on a whim with a group of friends in an American Institute of Chemical Engineers competition, where he was tasked with creating a 1-by-1 foot cube that could filter water to specifications provided by the competition. He says it was fun to apply what he was learning at MIT to a project all the way in Arizona.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kuffour enjoys discovering new things with friends as much as on his own. Three years ago, he started an intramural soccer team with friends from the &lt;a href="https://ome.mit.edu/interphase-edge/"&gt;Interphase EDGE&lt;/a&gt; program, which attracted many people he had never interacted with before. The team has been playing nearly every week since and Kuffour says the experience has been, “very enriching.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kuffour hopes other students will also seek out knowledge and experiences from a wide range of sources during their undergraduate years. He offers: “Try as many things as possible even if you think you know what you want to do, and appreciate everything life has to offer.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <description><![CDATA[High schooler Dustin Liang estimated his blood cell counts by applying knowledge from an MITx course and talking to doctors.]]></description>

    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2023/teen-uses-calculus-learned-through-mitx-better-understand-his-cancer-treatment-1103</guid>
        <dc:creator>Sara Feijo | MIT Open Learning</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When Dustin Liang was diagnosed with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in June, the cancer consumed his life. But despite a monthlong hospital stay, aggressive chemotherapy treatments, and ongoing headaches, fatigue, loss of appetite, and nausea, the 17-year-old high school senior enrolled in &lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt;’s class 18.01.1x (Calculus 1A: Differentiation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://openlearning.mit.edu/courses-programs/mitx-courses?f%5B0%5D=course_availability%3A62"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, part of MIT Open Learning, offers hundreds of high-quality massive open online courses adapted from the MIT classroom for learners worldwide. The Calculus 1A: Differentiation course was designed and created by the Department of Mathematics and offered through the &lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt; program. Liang took the free course this summer in between treatment sessions and medical tests so that he could meet the four-year math requirement to graduate from a Massachusetts high school — an arrangement he made with his school.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In class, Liang learned how to differentiate functions and how to make linear and quadratic approximations. He then applied this knowledge to estimate his blood cell counts. “I was in a hospital bed when I saw the doctor draw a graph of my neutrophils on a whiteboard, and I thought you could apply a quadratic approximation to it to estimate my blood cell counts at a certain time in the future,” Liang recalls. “I talked to the doctors about it, and they said it was a good idea but that they currently didn’t have the technology to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When doctors conduct blood tests on a patient, they look at multiple cell counts. Three of those are especially important for cancer patients: hemoglobin, which is the protein in red blood cells responsible for the delivery of oxygen to tissues; platelets, tiny blood cells that help the body form clots to stop bleeding; and neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that helps the body fight infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Heavy chemo kills all of the cells, regardless of whether they’re good or bad,” says Thomas Liang MS ’97, who is Dustin Liang’s father. “We asked the doctor a few times about the nadir [the lowest value of the neutrophil count after drug administration], but the doctors couldn't predict when Dustin would get to it. The anxiety was pretty high.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Liang was in the intensive care unit, his doctors ordered blood tests hourly to get a clearer picture of his blood cell counts. Being able to predict blood cell counts allows doctors to more accurately manage the next treatment procedure, and it allows patients and their caregivers to be more cautious and prepare for the next treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predicting neutrophil counts with math&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being hospitalized for weeks, Liang couldn’t wait to go home. He had his eyes locked on his absolute neutrophil count, which needed to reach 1,000 per microliter of blood in order for Liang to get discharged.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Calculus 1A, Liang was learning how to predict the near future value of a function using linear or quadratic approximation methods. After seeing a doctor’s chart of his neutrophils, Liang hypothesized that he could use quadratic approximation to predict his neutrophil count.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Given a series of points of the blood cell counts, a function can be modeled,” Liang explains. “So, predicting a future point not far away is mathematically feasible.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determined to test his idea, Liang called his mentor, Jiawen Sun, who works in a London security exchange firm as a trading analyst simulating and modeling stock market behavior. Sun helped Liang create a graph to estimate Liang’s neutrophil count at a certain time. When Liang compared the graph to his blood test results, he found that the math worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was able to predict the blood cell counts. It was a little off, but close enough,” Liang says. “There are some challenges in simulating the function of blood cells. However, the human blood cell counts turned out to be converging easier than the stock market to simulate.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Liang is working on a more accurate model for the neutrophil count based on input he received from doctors at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. He hopes to use data from other cancer patients to test his model; however, much more work will be needed to determine if this kind of model can be used on other patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If this works, it will alleviate some of the anxiety of cancer patients, and make their lives a little bit easier,” Liang says. “For doctors, they will be able to come up with more accurate procedures for treating cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Searching for better treatment options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liang completed Calculus 1A: Differentiation in September, receiving a grade of 100 percent on his final exam. “My other chemo had started, and I was feeling pretty bad when my dad told me the grade,” he recalls. “I’m proud I managed to accomplish something while I was undergoing chemo.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liang, who continues to undergo chemotherapy treatment, enrolled in class 18.01.2x (Calculus 1B: Integration) through &lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt; this fall semester. He is also taking an English class at his high school. After graduating from high school next year, Liang wants to study pre-med and become a cancer researcher.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was always pretty interested in the science field. Then I got cancer, and I got even more interested in it,” he says. “I want to research it, find ways to help people get rid of their cancer, and better patients’ treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Thomas Liang, his son’s survival is the first priority. “I want him to be a successful survivor,” he says. “Dustin is a brilliant kid and a chess prodigy. He thinks fast. He’s very sensitive. He doesn’t talk a lot, but is very popular among his friends. He's a kindhearted kid. I am proud of his aspirations to be a doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Florida Virtual School senior Jessica Wan was the winner of the 15th &lt;a href="https://mathprize.atfoundation.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Math Prize for Girls&lt;/a&gt; (MP4G) annual contest for female-identifying contestants, held Oct. 6-8 at MIT.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She scored 17 out of 20 questions, which added up to make Wan the MP4G’s most successful contestant in its history; she also won the contest last year and in 2019, as an eighth grader. (MP4G paused for two years at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.) Because Wan had won $82,000 in previous years, she was limited to only earning $18,000 this year by contest rules placing a $100,000 lifetime limit on winnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 262 U.S. and Canadian middle and high school contestants took a two-and-a-half-hour exam that featured 20 multistage problems in geometry, algebra, and trigonometry. Here's an example of one of the questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The frame of a painting has the form of a 105” by 105” square with a 95” by 95” square removed from its center. The frame is built out of congruent isosceles trapezoids with angles measuring 45 degrees and 135 degrees. Each trapezoid has one base on the frame’s outer edge and one base on the frame’s inner edge. Each outer edge of the frame contains an odd number of trapezoid bases that alternate long, short, long, short, etc. What is the maximum possible number of trapezoids in the frame?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hosted by the MIT Department of Mathematics and sponsored by the &lt;a href="https://www.atfoundation.org/"&gt;Advantage Testing Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and global trading firm &lt;a href="https://www.janestreet.com/"&gt;Jane Street&lt;/a&gt;, the MP4G weekend culminated in an awards ceremony held at the Marriott in Kendall Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts. MIT electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) &lt;a href="https://www.regina.csail.mit.edu/"&gt;Professor Regina Barzilay&lt;/a&gt; gave the Maryam Mirzakhani keynote lecture, “Uncovering Mysteries of Life Sciences with Machine Learning.” The event was emceed by MP4G alumna In Young Cho, a quantitative trader from Jane Street who placed third in 2010, and featured a performance by the &lt;a href="https://logarhythms.squarespace.com/"&gt;MIT Logarhythms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In second place was eighth grader Selena Ge of Jonas Clarke Middle School in Lexington, Massachusetts, with a score of 14 to earn $20,000. She also was awarded a Youth Prize of $2,000 as the highest-scoring contestant in ninth grade or below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next four winners were junior Hannah Fox of Proof School in California, who received $10,000 with a score of 12; with scores of 11 each, $4,000 was awarded to sophomores Shruti Arun of Cherry Creek High School in Colorado, Catherine Xu of Iowa City West High School in Iowa, and senior Miranda Wang of Kent Place School in New Jersey. The next 12 winners received $1,000 each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full list of winners is posted on the &lt;a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c132h3174321_math_prize_2023_award_winners"&gt;Art of Problem Solving website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top 41 students are invited to take the 2023 Math Prize for Girls Olympiad at their schools. Canada/USA Mathcamp also provides $250 merit scholarships to the top 35 students who enroll in its summer program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A networking opportunity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and Canadian attendees are not just competing in a math contest; they are part of an ever-growing MP4G alumnae network to push against gender stereotypes within STEM fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The founders of MP4G are proud dads of STEMcentric women. MP4G director &lt;a href="https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=1659"&gt;Ravi Boppana&lt;/a&gt; PhD ’86, who is also a research affiliate at MIT's Department of Mathematics, and his wife, panel moderator Ranu Boppana ’87, are the parents of&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/meenaboppana/"&gt;Meena Boppana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;who works for an online education company as a producer of computer science and math curricula&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Advantage Testing president Arun Alagappan has three daughters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year’s MP4G volunteers attended an orientation dinner on the Friday before the contest, to make MP4G more of a full weekend experience. The next day, contestants competed in fun activities, such as Figgie (a card game involving probability) and an Estimathon (a team-based contest), along with bracelet-making, a photo booth, and dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lounge was set up for the contestants’ families, who attended Sunday’s ­­­MP4G alumnae panel while their children took the exam. Moderated by Ranu Boppana, the panel also included Jane Ahn; Jessica "Jessie" Oehrlein; Alicia Ouyang, a graduate student in MIT's Technical Policy program; and Justina Yang ’19. Another panelist, EECS graduate student &lt;a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/lalita-devadas"&gt;Lalita (Lali) Devadas&lt;/a&gt;, is the daughter of MP4G program administrator Sulochana Devadas and MIT PRIMES (Program for Research in Mathematics, Engineering and Science) Computer Science Section coordinator and EECS Professor &lt;a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/devadas/"&gt;Srini Devadas&lt;/a&gt;. Students and parents were also invited to an information session and campus tour with MIT Admissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A growing network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MP4G is the largest contest of its kind in North America, which makes it a valuable networking opportunity for women seeking STEM careers. Over the years, the MP4G participants have become professors, doctors, business leaders, engineers, computer and biomedical scientists, and mathematicians; they work in aviation, robotics, artificial intelligence, and financial services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since founding MP4G 15 years ago, Boppana and Alagappan have evolved the MP4G contest to be more of a math camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“At the first Math Prize in 2009, I remember wondering whether the girls would come only from the Northeast part of the United States,” recalls Ravi Boppana. “It turns out, I was wildly off. The contestants came from 31 different states, including 60 from California. More than 20 contestants came from Canada, from five different provinces. Four girls flew from China and India to participate. I couldn't have imagined so much worldwide excitement when we started.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our first year, we provided only the exam and an awards ceremony. Since then, we have expanded the program so much. It's become much more social, including full meals, games, and networking.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, MP4G added another tool for bringing together participants from all over the world: a Discord community. Many contestants, including alumni who went on to become MIT students, return to volunteer with setup, registration, exam proctoring, grading, and hosting contestants in their dorm rooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s so inspiring to see these incredibly talented young women gather at MIT every autumn,” says Chris Peterson, director of special projects at MIT Admissions and Student Financial Services, who has delivered information sessions at the event for more than a decade. “Not just because of their excellence at competition math, but because of how their shared affinity for competition math generates a powerful sense of community between women from all over the country, one that often starts here at Games Night and continues across many years, campuses, and jobs. This social network is transformative, not just for the participants, but for every institution, organization, and field they enter.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MP4G alumna &lt;a href="https://www.rachelyunzhang.com/"&gt;Rachel Zhang&lt;/a&gt; ’21, now a doctoral candidate at EECS studying theoretical computer science, was happy to volunteer this year as a contest lead proctor. She seeks to pay it forward, because she credits MP4G with not only giving her confidence as a high school math contest competitor, but also for allowing her to meet STEM-focused girls like herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When I attended in ninth grade, it was my first time meeting other girls who loved math like I did,” she recalls. “I even got to meet a good friend I'd met online through Art of Problem Solving in person for the first time. Math Prize played a unique role in rekindling my friendships with other girls and helping us all to stay in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think Math Prize is a wonderful competition, drawing together students from across the country who might have otherwise never crossed paths, and giving them a chance to meet, connect, and inspire each other.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winner Jessica Wan knows that she’ll be back to volunteer for MP4G.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“While I'm quite proud of my performance and enjoyed tackling the various challenges in the test, for me the highlights of the event were its social aspects and all the time it provided to bond with fellow mathletes from across the country,” she says. “MP4G has been one of my favorite math competitions/events for years; since my first attendance in sixth grade, I've met and reconnected with more friends each year.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Five MIT professors have been selected to receive the &lt;a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/grant/simons-investigators/?tab=awardees&amp;amp;filter_years=2023"&gt;2023 Simons Investigators awards&lt;/a&gt; from the Simons Foundation. Virginia Vassilevska Williams and Vinod Vaikuntanathan are both professors in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and principal investigators in MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). Aram Harrow and Leonid Mirny are professors in the Department of Physics, and Davesh Maulik is a professor in the Department of Mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Simons Investigator program supports “outstanding theoretical scientists who receive a stable base of research support from the foundation, enabling them to undertake the long-term study of fundamental questions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.mit.edu/aram/www/" target="_blank"&gt;Aram Harrow&lt;/a&gt; '01, PhD '05, professor of physics, studies theoretical quantum information science in order to understand the capabilities of quantum computers and quantum communication devices. Harrow has developed quantum algorithms for solving large systems of linear equations and hybrid classical-quantum algorithms for machine learning, and has also contributed to the intersection of quantum information and many-body physics, with work on thermalization, random quantum dynamics, and the “monogamy” property of quantum entanglement. He was a lecturer at the University of Bristol and a research assistant professor at the University of Washington until joining MIT in 2013. His awards include the NSF CAREER award, several best paper awards, an APS Outstanding Referee Award, and the APS Rolf Landauer and Charles H Bennett Award in Quantum Computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=177" target="_blank"&gt;Davesh Maulik&lt;/a&gt; joined the Department of Mathematics at MIT in 2015. He works in algebraic geometry, with an emphasis on the geometry of moduli spaces. In many cases, this involves using ideas from neighboring fields such as representation theory, symplectic geometry, and number theory. His most recent work has focused on moduli spaces of Higgs bundles and various conjectures regarding their structure. In the past, he has received a Clay Mathematics Research Fellowship and the Compositio Mathematica Prize with coauthors for an outstanding research publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/leonid-mirny/" target="_blank"&gt;Leonid Mirny&lt;/a&gt;, the Richard J. Cohen (1976) Professor in Medicine and Biomedical Physics, is a core faculty member at the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES), and is faculty at the Department of Physics. His work combines biophysical modeling with analysis of large genomics data to address fundamental problems in biology. Mirny aims to understand how exceedingly long molecules of DNA are folded in 3D, and how this 3D folding of the genome influences gene expression and execution of genetic programs in health and disease. His prediction that the genome is folded by a new class of motors that act by “loop extrusion” was experimentally confirmed, leading a paradigm shift in chromosome biology. Broadly, Mirny is interested in unraveling physical mechanisms that underlie reading, writing, and transmission of genetic and epigenetic information. He was awarded the 2019 Blaise Pascal International Chair of Excellence and was named a Fellow of the American Physical Society. He received his MS in chemistry from the Weizmann Institute of Science, and his PhD in biophysics from Harvard University, where he also served as a junior fellow at Harvard Society of Fellows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/people/vinod-vaikuntanathan/" target="_blank"&gt;Vinod Vaikuntanathan&lt;/a&gt; is a professor of computer science at MIT. The co-inventor of modern fully homomorphic encryption systems and many other lattice-based (and post-quantum secure) cryptographic primitives, Vaikuntanathan’s work has been recognized with a George M. Sprowls PhD thesis award, an IBM Josef Raviv Fellowship, a Sloan Faculty Fellowship, a Microsoft Faculty Fellowship, an NSF CAREER Award, a DARPA Young Faculty Award, a Harold E. Edgerton Faculty Award, Test of Time awards from IEEE FOCS and CRYPTO conferences, and a Gödel prize. Vaikuntanathan earned his SM and PhD degrees from MIT, and a BTech degree from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/people/virginia-williams/" target="_blank"&gt;Virginia Vassilevska Williams&lt;/a&gt; is a professor of computer science at MIT EECS. Williams’s research focuses on algorithm design and analysis of fundamental problems involving graphs, matrices and more, seeking to determine the precise (asymptotic) time complexity of these problems. She has designed the fastest algorithm for matrix multiplication and is widely regarded as the leading expert on fine-grained complexity. Among her many awards, she has received an NSF CAREER award; a Sloan Research Fellowship; a Google Faculty Research Award, a Thornton Family Faculty Research Innovation Fellowship (FRIF), and was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 2018. Williams earned her MS and PhD degrees at Carnegie Mellon University, and her BS degree at Caltech.&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:creator>Terri Park | MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This fall, the &lt;a href="https://cse.mit.edu/"&gt;Center for Computational Science and Engineering&lt;/a&gt; (CCSE), an academic unit in the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, is introducing a new standalone PhD degree program that will enable students to pursue research in cross-cutting methodological aspects of computational science and engineering. The launch follows approval of the center’s degree program proposal at the May 2023 Institute faculty meeting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doctoral-level graduate study in computational science and engineering (CSE) at MIT has, for the past decade, been offered through an &lt;a href="https://cse.mit.edu/programs/phd/"&gt;interdisciplinary program&lt;/a&gt; in which CSE students are admitted to one of eight participating academic departments in the School of Engineering or School of Science. While this model adds a strong disciplinary component to students’ education, the rapid growth of the CSE field and the establishment of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing have prompted an exciting expansion of MIT’s graduate-level offerings in computation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new degree, offered by the college, will run alongside MIT’s existing interdisciplinary offerings in CSE, complementing these doctoral training programs and preparing students to contribute to the leading edge of the field. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here, CCSE co-directors Youssef Marzouk and Nicolas Hadjiconstantinou discuss the standalone program and how they expect it to elevate the visibility and impact of CSE research and education at MIT.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What is computational science and engineering?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marzouk:&lt;/strong&gt; Computational science and engineering focuses on the development and analysis of state-of-the-art methods for computation and their innovative application to problems of science and engineering interest. It has intellectual foundations in applied mathematics, statistics, and computer science, and touches the full range of science and engineering disciplines. Yet, it synthesizes these foundations into a discipline of its own — one that links the digital and physical worlds. It’s an exciting and evolving multidisciplinary field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hadjiconstantinou:&lt;/strong&gt; Examples of &lt;a href="https://cse.mit.edu/research/"&gt;CSE research&lt;/a&gt; happening at MIT include modeling and simulation techniques, the underlying computational mathematics, and data-driven modeling of physical systems. Computational statistics and scientific machine learning have become prominent threads within CSE, joining high-performance computing, mathematically-oriented programming languages, and their broader links to algorithms and software. Application domains include energy, environment and climate, materials, health, transportation, autonomy, and aerospace, among others. Some of our researchers focus on general and widely applicable methodology, while others choose to focus on methods and algorithms motivated by a specific domain of application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What was the motivation behind creating a standalone PhD program?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marzouk: &lt;/strong&gt;The new degree focuses on a particular class of students whose background and interests are primarily in CSE methodology, in a manner that cuts across the disciplinary research structure represented by our current “with-departments” degree program. There is a strong research demand for such methodologically-focused students among CCSE faculty and MIT faculty in general. Our objective is to create a targeted, coherent degree program in this field that, alongside our other thriving CSE offerings, will create the leading environment for top CSE students worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hadjiconstantinou: &lt;/strong&gt;One of CCSE’s most important functions is to recruit exceptional students who are trained in and want to work in computational science and engineering. Experience with our &lt;a href="https://cse.mit.edu/programs/sm/"&gt;CSE master’s program&lt;/a&gt; suggests that students with a strong background and interests in the discipline prefer to apply to a pure CSE program for their graduate studies.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The standalone degree aims to bring these students to MIT and make them available to faculty across the Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;How will this impact computing education and research at MIT?&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hadjiconstantinou:&lt;/strong&gt; We believe that offering a standalone PhD program in CSE alongside the existing “with-departments” programs will significantly strengthen MIT’s graduate programs in computing. In particular, it will strengthen the methodological core of CSE research and education at MIT, while continuing to support the disciplinary-flavored CSE work taking place in our participating departments, which include Aeronautics and Astronautics; Chemical Engineering; Civil and Environmental Engineering; Materials Science and Engineering; Mechanical Engineering; Nuclear Science and Engineering; Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences; and Mathematics. Together, these programs will create a stronger CSE student cohort and facilitate deeper exchanges between the college and other units at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marzouk: &lt;/strong&gt;In a broader sense, the new program is designed to help realize one of the key opportunities presented by the college, which is to create a richer variety of graduate degrees in computation and to involve as many faculty and units in these educational endeavors as possible. The standalone CSE PhD will join other distinguished &lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/academics/graduate-programs/"&gt;doctoral programs of the college&lt;/a&gt; — such as the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science PhD; the Operations Research Center PhD; and the Interdisciplinary Doctoral Program in Statistics and the Social and Engineering Systems PhD within the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society — and grow in a way that is informed by them. The confluence of these academic programs, and natural synergies among them, will make MIT quite unique.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>School of Science welcomes new faculty in 2023</title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2023/school-science-welcomes-new-faculty-0925</link>
  <description><![CDATA[Sixteen professors join the departments of Biology; Chemistry; Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences; Mathematics; and Physics.]]></description>
  <pubDate>Mon, 25 Sep 2023 15:55:00 -0400</pubDate>

        <dc:creator>School of Science</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Last spring, the School of Science welcomed seven new faculty members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://biology.mit.edu/profile/y-erin-chen/" target="_blank"&gt;Erin Chen&lt;/a&gt; PhD ’11 studies the communication between microbes that reside on the surface of the human body and the immune system. She focuses on the largest organ: the skin. Chen will dissect the molecular signals of diverse skin microbes and their effects on host tissues, with the goal of harnessing microbe-host interactions to engineer new therapeutics for human disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chen earned her bachelor’s in biology from the University of Chicago, her PhD from MIT, and her MD from Harvard Medical School, and she completed her medical residency at the University of California at San Francisco. Chen was also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Hanna Gray Fellow at Stanford University and an attending dermatologist at UCSF and at the San Francisco VA Medical Center. Chen returns to MIT as an assistant professor in the Department of Biology, a core member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and an attending dermatologist at Massachusetts General Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://chemistry.mit.edu/profile/robert-j-gilliard/"&gt;Robert Gilliard&lt;/a&gt;’s research is multidisciplinary and combines various aspects of organic, inorganic, main-group, and materials chemistry. The Gilliard group specializes in the chemical synthesis of new molecules that impact the development of new catalysts and reagents, including the discovery of unknown transformations of environmentally relevant small-molecules [e.g., carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and dihydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]. In addition, he investigates the design, characterization, and reactivity of boron-based luminescent and redox-active heterocycles for use in optoelectronic applications (e.g., stimuli-responsive materials, thermochromic materials, chemical sensors).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gilliard earned his bachelor’s degree from Clemson University and his PhD from the University of Georgia. He completed joint postdoctoral studies at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zürich) and Case Western Reserve University. He served on the faculty at the University of Virginia from 2017-22. Gilliard spent time in the MIT Department of Chemistry as a 2021-22 Dr. Martin Luther King Visiting Professor. He returns as the Novartis Associate Professor of Chemistry with tenure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://biology.mit.edu/profile/sally-kornbluth/" target="_blank"&gt;Sally Kornbluth&lt;/a&gt; is president of MIT and a professor of biology. Before she closed her lab to focus on administration, her research focused on the biological signals that tell a cell to start dividing or to self-destruct — processes that are key to understanding cancer as well as various degenerative disorders. She has published extensively on cell proliferation and programmed cell death, studying both phenomena in a variety of organisms. Her research has helped to show how cancer cells evade this programmed death, or apoptosis, and how metabolism regulates the cell death process; her work has also clarified the role of apoptosis in regulating the duration of female fertility in vertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="x_MsoNormal"&gt;Kornbluth holds bachelor’s degrees in political science from Williams College and in genetics from Cambridge University. She earned her PhD in molecular oncology from Rockefeller University in 1989 and completed postdoctoral training at the University of California at San Diego. In 1994, she joined the faculty of Duke University and served in the administration as vice dean for basic science at the Duke School of Medicine&amp;nbsp;(2006-2014)&amp;nbsp;and later as&amp;nbsp;the university's&amp;nbsp;provost&amp;nbsp;(2014-2022). She is a member of the National Academy of Medicine, the National Academy of Inventors, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://biology.mit.edu/profile/daniel-lew/"&gt;Daniel Lew&lt;/a&gt; uses fungal model systems to ask how cells orient their activities in space, including oriented growth, cell wall remodeling, and organelle segregation. Different cells take on an astonishing variety of shapes, which are often critical to be able to perform specialized cell functions like absorbing nutrients or contracting muscles. Lew studies how different cell shapes arise and how cells control the spatial distribution of their internal constituents, taking advantage of the tractability of fungal model systems, and addressing these questions using approaches from cell biology, genetics, and computational biology to understand molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lew received a bachelor’s degree in genetics from Cambridge University followed by a PhD in molecular biology from Rockefeller University. After postdoctoral training at the Scripps Research Institute, he joined the Duke University faculty in 1994. Lew joins MIT as a professor of biology with tenure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/eluned-smith/"&gt;Eluned Smith&lt;/a&gt; uses rare beauty decays measured with the LHCb detector at CERN to search for new fundamental particles at mass scales above the collision energy of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Her group leverages data to elucidate the physics of beauty quarks, whose behavior cannot be explained by the Standard Model of particle physics. In doing so, her work aims to resolve whether the anomalies are misunderstood quantum chromodynamics or the first sign of beyond-the-Standard-Model-physics at the LHC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smith joins MIT as an assistant professor in the Department of Physics and the Laboratory for Nuclear Science. She earned her undergraduate and doctoral degrees at Imperial College London, which she completed in 2017. She did her first postdoc at RWTH Aachen before winning an Ambizione Fellowship from the Swiss National Science Foundation at the University of Zürich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://eapsweb.mit.edu/people/gaias"&gt;Gaia Stucky de Quay&lt;/a&gt; explores topographic signals and landscape evolution, in order to both de-convolve and quantify primary driving forces such as tectonics, climate, and local geological processes. She integrates fieldwork, lab work, modeling, and remote sensing to improve our quantitative understanding of such processes at compelling geological sites such as Martian valleys and lakes, the surfaces of icy moons, and volcanic islands in the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stucky de Quay joins the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences as an assistant professor. Most recently, she was a Daly Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard University. Previously, she was a postdoc at the University of Texas at Austin and a visiting student at the University of Chicago. Stucky de Quay earned her MS from the University College of London and a PhD from Imperial College London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://biology.mit.edu/profile/brandon-weissbourd/"&gt;Brandon "Brady" Weissbourd&lt;/a&gt; uses the jellyfish, &lt;em&gt;Clytia hemisphaerica&lt;/em&gt;, to study nervous system evolution, development, regeneration, and function. With a foundation is in systems neuroscience, his lab uses genetic and optical techniques to examine how behavior arises from the activity of networks of neurons; they investigate how the &lt;em&gt;Clytia&lt;/em&gt; nervous system is so robust; and they use &lt;em&gt;Clytia’s&lt;/em&gt; evolutionary position to make inferences about the ultimate origins of nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weissbourd received a BA in human evolutionary biology from Harvard University in 2009 and a PhD from Stanford University in 2016. He then completed postdoctoral research at Caltech and The Howard Hughes Medical Institute. He joins MIT as an assistant professor in the Department of Biology and an investigator in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fall, the School of Science welcomes nine new faculty members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://biology.mit.edu/profile/facundo-batista/"&gt;Facundo Batista&lt;/a&gt; studies the fundamental biology of the immune system to develop the next generation of vaccines and therapeutics. B lymphocytes are the fulcrum of immunological memory, the source of antibodies, and the focus of vaccine development. His lab has investigated how, where, and when B cell responses take shape. In recent years, the Batista group has expanded into preclinical vaccinology, targeting viruses including HIV, malaria, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Batista is an MIT professor of biology with tenure as well as the associate director and scientific director of the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard. He received his PhD from the International School of Advanced Studies in Trieste, Italy, and his undergraduate degree from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Prior to MIT, Batista was a tenured member of the Francis Crick Institute, a professor at Imperial College London, and a professor of microbiology and immunology at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/anna-christina-eilers/"&gt;Anna-Christina Eilers&lt;/a&gt; is an observational astrophysicist. Her research focuses on the formation of the first galaxies, quasars, and supermassive black holes in the early universe, during an era known as the Cosmic Dawn. In particular, Eilers is interested in the growth of the first supermassive black holes which reside in the center of luminous, distant galaxies known as quasars, to understand how black holes evolve from small stellar remnants to billion-solar-mass black holes within very short amounts of cosmic time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, Eilers received a bachelor’s degree in physics from the University of Goettingen, a master’s degree in astrophysics from the University of Heidelberg, and a PhD in astrophysics from the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg. In 2019, she was awarded a NASA Hubble Fellowship and the Pappalardo Fellowship to continue her research at MIT. Eilers remains at MIT as an assistant professor in the Department of Physics and the MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://chemistry.mit.edu/profile/masha-elkin/"&gt;Masha Elkin&lt;/a&gt; combines catalyst development, natural products synthesis, and machine learning to tackle important chemical challenges. Her group develops new transition metal catalysts that enable efficient bond disconnections and access to value-added compounds, leveraging these transformations for the synthesis of bioactive natural products that address outstanding needs in human health, and uses computational tools to explore all possible molecules and accelerate reaction discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elkin joins MIT as the D. Reid (1941) and Barbara J. Weedon Career Development Assistant Professor of Chemistry. She earned her bachelor’s degree in chemistry from Washington University in St. Louis in 2014, and her PhD from Yale University in 2019, then began as a postdoc at the University of California at Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/mikhail-ivanov/"&gt;Mikhail Ivanov&lt;/a&gt;’s research has developed at the interface of theoretical physics and data analysis, bridging state-of-the-art theoretical ideas with observational data. The overarching aim of his research is to use Effective Field Theory in combination with astrophysical data in order to resolve fundamental challenges of modern physics, such as the nature of dark matter, dark energy, inflation, and gravity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ivanov joins MIT as an assistant professor in the Department of Physics and the Center for Theoretical Physics in the Laboratory for Nuclear Science. He obtained his PhD from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in 2019. During his PhD studies, he spent a year at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, as a fellow of the Swiss National Science Foundation. Subsequently, he was a postdoc at New York University and a NASA Einstein Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://chemistry.mit.edu/profile/oleta-johnson/"&gt;Oleta Johnson&lt;/a&gt; joins the Department of Chemistry as an assistant professor. Efforts to target pathogenic proteins with drugs or chemical probes can often be analogized to a lock and key, where the protein target is the “lock” and the molecule is the “key.” However, what happens when the target is flexible or lacks a defined structure? In all living things, molecular chaperone proteins have evolved to support proper folding of these moving targets. Yet, protein misfolding and aggregation is a hallmark of many myopathies and neurodegenerative diseases. Johnson uses chemical and biophysical tools to understand and tune the activity of molecular chaperone proteins in protein misfolding diseases. Thus, her research group will reveal the molecular underpinnings of molecular chaperone dysfunction in a broad array of disorders including Huntington’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. These tools and finding will be further developed to develop novel treatments for patients of these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnson earned her bachelor’s degree in biochemistry from Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University in 2013, and her PhD from the University of Michigan in 2018. Prior to MIT, Johnson completed postdoctoral research at the University of California at San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://eapsweb.mit.edu/people/nxnie"&gt;Nicole Xike Nie&lt;/a&gt; is an isotope geo/cosmochemist using the chemical and isotopic compositions of extraterrestrial materials to understand the formation of our solar system. Her research is driven by fundamental questions about the origin and evolution of the early solar system. Leveraging geochemical methods, she wants to understand questions such as why all planetary bodies are depleted of volatile elements when their building block materials aren’t, and why the Earth’s chemical signatures are distinct from other planetary bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nie joins MIT as an assistant professor in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences. Nie received a BS in geology from China University of Geosciences in 2010, an MS in geochemistry from Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2013, and a PhD in geo/cosmochemistry from the University of Chicago in 2019. After graduating she was a Carnegie Postdoc Fellow at Carnegie Institution for Science and a postdoc researcher at Caltech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=2272"&gt;Tristan Ozuch&lt;/a&gt; works in the field of geometric analysis and focuses on Einstein manifolds and Ricci flows. His work has shed light on the moduli space of Einstein metrics in four dimensions, addressing questions that have lingered since the 1980s. These questions originated from the systematic study of Einstein's equations and their degenerations since the 1970s, in both physics and mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After receiving a bachelor's degree, master's degree, and PhD from École Normale Supérieure, Tristan Ozuch joined MIT as a C.L.E. Moore Instructor of Mathematics. He continues in the Department of Mathematics as an assistant&amp;nbsp;professor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate scientist &lt;a href="https://eapsweb.mit.edu/people/taliatb" target="_blank"&gt;Talia Tamarin-Brodsky&lt;/a&gt;’s research is driven by questions on the interface between weather and climate. In her work, Tamarin-Brodsky combines theory, computational methods, and observational data to study Earth’s climate and weather and how they respond to climate change. Her interests include atmospheric dynamics, temperature variability, weather and climate extremes, and subseasonal-to-seasonal predictability. For example, she studies how nonlinear wave breaking events in the upper atmosphere influence surface weather and extremes, and the mechanisms shaping the spatial distribution of Earth’s near-surface temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tamarin-Brodsky received a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and geophysics as well as a master’s in physics from Tel Aviv University, Israel, before earning her PhD from the Weizmann Institute. She completed a postdoctoral project at the University of Reading, U.K., and a postdoctoral fellowship at Tel Aviv University. She joins the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Studies as an assistant professor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://math.mit.edu/~urschel/"&gt;John Urschel&lt;/a&gt; PhD ’21 is a mathematician focused on matrix analysis and computations, with an emphasis on theoretical results and provable guarantees for practical problems. His research interests include numerical linear algebra, spectral graph theory, and topics in theoretical machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urschel earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in mathematics from Pennsylvania State University, then completed a PhD in mathematics at MIT in 2021. He was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study and a junior fellow at Harvard University before returning to MIT as an assistant professor of mathematics this fall.&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:creator>Lillian Eden | Department of Biology</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A group of more than 50 individuals recently had the pleasure of sitting down for an informal chat at MIT with distinguished educator, author, and mathematician Freeman Hrabowski. The group was predominantly composed of MIT Summer Research Program in Biology (MSRP-Bio) students and alumni and current students from the &lt;a href="https://meyerhoff.umbc.edu/"&gt;Meyerhoff Scholars Program&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://umbc.edu/"&gt;University of Maryland, Baltimore County&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hrabowski is widely credited for transforming &lt;a href="https://umbc.edu/"&gt;UMBC&lt;/a&gt; into a world-renowned, innovative institution while serving as its president from 1992 to 2022. The educator also ushered in a generation of Black students to earn PhDs in science and engineering, co-founding the &lt;a href="https://meyerhoff.umbc.edu/"&gt;Meyerhoff Scholars Program at UMBC&lt;/a&gt;. Founded in 1988, the program has become a national model for increasing diversity in STEM. Hrabowski was also a member of the President's Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for African Americans during the Obama administration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hrabowski began by quoting poet William Carlos Williams: "It is difficult to get the news from poems yet men die miserable every day for lack of what is found there," and leading a call-and-response recitation of the poem &lt;a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/150995/dreams-5d767850da976"&gt;"Dreams," by Langston Hughes,&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MITBiology/status/1677712004402782210?s=20"&gt;a mantra encouraging&lt;/a&gt; students to use their words, actions, and habits to shape their character and their destiny. Afterward, the students asked Hrabowski about his life and experiences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The audience of high-achieving students asked terrific, insightful questions reflecting their contemplation of their own paths," says Department of Biology head Amy Keating. "When students spoke up, Hrabowski engaged with them, and their ideas and perspectives were welcomed and respected. By the end of his time with them, almost everyone had their hand up and wanted to contribute to the lively discussion."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tobias Coombs, a Meyerhoff Scholars program alumnus and current graduate student in the &lt;a href="https://biology.mit.edu/profile/stefani-spranger/"&gt;Spranger Lab&lt;/a&gt;, says the event was an example of "classic Freeman Hrabowski:" Hrabowski injected the crowd with excitement and energy. Coombs also remarked that Hrabowski, named by &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; as one of the world’s &lt;a href="https://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2111975_2111976_2112119,00.html"&gt;most influential people in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, acknowledged to the group that he's shy, something Hrabowski is still pushing himself to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"He makes a point of being this down-to-earth person that you feel you can talk to about real issues and have real conversations with," Coombs says. "He genuinely wants to motivate you to think science and math are cool."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before taking questions from the students in attendance, Hrabowski posed one to them: What do you think it takes to be successful in research in STEM? Among the responses were passion, curiosity, and a supportive community. After each response, Hrabowski encouraged a round of applause for each student brave enough to stand and give an answer because "everybody needs support."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The way that you think about yourselves, the language that you use, the way that you interact with each other, and the values that you hold, will be so important. You become like the things that you love," Hrabowski says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For his lifetime of accomplishments increasing diversity in STEM, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute recently announced a new program named after Hrabowski. &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/seychelle-vos-hernandez-moura-silva-named-hhmi-freeman-hrabowski-scholars-0509"&gt;The HHMI Freeman Hrabowski Scholars&lt;/a&gt; were selected for their potential to become leaders in their research fields and to foster diverse and inclusive lab environments. The inaugural class of 31 scholars includes MIT biology faculty members &lt;a href="https://biology.mit.edu/profile/seychelle-m-vos/"&gt;Seychelle Vos&lt;/a&gt;, the Robert A. Swanson Career Development Professor of Life Sciences, and &lt;a href="https://biology.mit.edu/profile/hernandez-moura-silva/"&gt;Hernandez Moura Silva&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor and Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard core member, as well as MIT biology and Cheeseman lab alumna &lt;a href="https://hsci.harvard.edu/people/kara-mckinley-phd"&gt;Kara McKinley&lt;/a&gt; PhD '16.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vos and Moura Silva were among the faculty attending the event, and both say Hrabowski was an inspiring guest to have on campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Dr. Hrabowski's smile, energy, and words are a true force of nature," Hernandez says. "His words of wisdom showed us that we can all make the impossible possible by bringing a positive attitude to build a strong, supportive, and diverse community. It was such an honor to have him here."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biology department undergraduate officer Adam Martin says he noticed the pride in Hrabowski’s eyes when Hrabowski discussed what his trainees and faculty in his programs have accomplished. Biology department graduate officer Mary Gehring said his visit made her remember why she wanted to be a professor: “to help others follow their passions to their full potential.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hrabowski reflected on many topics, including the recent Supreme Court ruling on affirmative action. He pointed out that this was not the first time the Supreme Court had ruled on a racially conscious initiative, namely the 1995 decision that a &lt;a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1995-05-23-1995143006-story.html"&gt;UMBC scholarship program was unconstitutional&lt;/a&gt;. To continue the Meyerhoff Scholars Program, which was affected by the Supreme Court decision at the time, Hrabowski worked with Maryland's attorney general, found language and methods to encourage broad participation of diverse individuals, and focused on what the program was trying to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"My message to everyone was 'where there's a will, there's a way.' If the institution wants to continue to build diversity and broader participation, we can do it," he says. "What we're working to achieve in the Meyerhoff program and in the Freeman Hrabowski Scholars program is to have everybody included."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hrabowski also offered advice on more everyday challenges: good students, himself included, can focus too much, forgetting to make time for other important aspects of their lives. He has learned to make time for tai chi, acupuncture, and getting his steps in; he encouraged the students similarly to take time for themselves outside work or school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When you can have fun and laugh, you're a much better person. You can be a better thinker if you take care of yourself overall," he says. "It's the healthy person who can be most effective."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for being intimidated or nervous to talk to a superior, Hrabowski had the room roaring with laughter at his advice: "Just remember they go to the bathroom, too."&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keating noted that Hrabowski engaged with the audience with energy, compassion, and humor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also observed, "No one can hide in Dr. Hrabowski's classroom."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"He put students front and center in his presentation, and his emphasis on the joys and importance of learning, knowledge, and achievement inspired us all to go back to the lab and classroom and be our best selves," Keating says. "He acknowledged that paths in STEM demand much of us, and he encouraged students to have the discipline needed to stay the course while also taking care of themselves."&lt;/p&gt;

    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2023/hertz-foundation-fellowships-0621</guid>
        <dc:creator>Elizabeth Durant | Office of the Vice Chancellor</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Fannie and John Hertz Foundation has &lt;a href="https://www.hertzfoundation.org/news/fannie-and-john-hertz-foundation-announces-2023-hertz-fellows/" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it has awarded graduate fellowships to six students with ties to MIT. These prestigious awards provide each student with five years of doctoral-level research funding (up to a total of $250,000), which gives them flexibility and autonomy to pursue their own research interests, beyond the traditional graduate training path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fellows also enjoy lifelong mentoring and professional support from a network of over 1,200 former Hertz Fellows who are scholars and leaders in science and technology. The connections forged among these individuals in the 60 years since the inception of the Hertz Foundation have sparked collaborative startups, research, and technology commercialization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The six MIT recipients are among 15 doctoral scholars selected from around the United States. “The innovation, creativity, deep and connected knowledge, grit and determination, and ambition to make an impact displayed by this cohort stand out and promise great things for the years to come,” says Philip Welkhoff, a 2004 Hertz Fellow and board director who leads the selection process. “We are all excited to see the advances they develop over their careers that will drive progress across so many areas of endeavor, resulting in new scientific knowledge, new technologies, and strengthened national security.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year’s MIT-affiliated awardees are Jeffrey Brown, Liyam Chitayat, Vaibhav Mohanty, Sahil Pontula ’23, Benjamin Spector ’22, MEng ’22, and Beatriz Yankelevich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jeffrey Brown&lt;/strong&gt; is pursuing a PhD at MIT in electrical engineering and computer science and is a member of the Synthetic Neurobiology Group led by Professor Ed Boyden — who is also a Hertz Fellow. As an undergraduate at Stanford University, Brown majored in philosophy and completed two master’s degrees, one in computer science and one in electrical engineering. There, he developed a passion for neural engineering, working on the Stanford Artificial Retina Project, an initiative to restore vision through retinal prostheses. At MIT, Brown wants to develop novel computational and biological tools for seeing and controlling biological systems and create new computational methods to find the hidden principles within the data. Drawing on these principles, he hopes to tackle understanding the brain and curing neuropsychiatric diseases from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liyam Chitayat &lt;/strong&gt;will begin her doctoral program in computational and systems biology at MIT this fall. She aims to develop fundamental technologies and biological interfaces to enable human enhancement on a physiological and molecular level.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Chitayat began her undergraduate studies at Tel Aviv University at age 12, completing double majors in chemistry and biology and graduating summa cum laude in both fields. She is currently completing her master’s degree in biomedical engineering, where she has aimed to develop novel computational methods for microbiome engineering. She has also served in the bioengineering department at the Israeli Ministry of Defense, Directorate of Defense Research and Innovation, leading computational biology efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaibhav Mohanty &lt;/strong&gt;is a graduate student in the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology, where his research focuses on the intersection of theoretical physics, chemistry, and evolutionary biology to develop mutational “traps” to combat the rapid evolution of proteins in infectious pathogens and in cancer. He received his first PhD in theoretical physics from the University of Oxford, where he studied as a Marshall Scholar. Prior to that, Mohanty earned a master’s degree in chemistry and a bachelor’s degree summa cum laude in chemistry and physics with a minor in music from Harvard University, where he was awarded a Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sahil Pontula ’23 &lt;/strong&gt;completed two bachelor’s degrees at MIT in physics and electrical engineering and will remain at the Institute to begin a doctoral program in electrical engineering and computer science in the fall. His doctoral research will center on using nonlinear and quantum optics to generate reliable sources of macroscopic quantum states of light, which could revolutionize existing quantum information and sensing platforms. In addition, he plans to explore more unconventional paths, such as pursuing his passion for climate activism by harnessing the power of quantum optics and nanophotonics for energy applications, including enhanced batteries and photovoltaic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benjamin Spector ’22, MEng ’22 &lt;/strong&gt;is pursuing a PhD in computer science at Stanford University, where his research combines systems and machine learning; in particular, he focuses on creating new methods and architectures for robust and transparent artificial intelligence while enabling adoption by a growing scientific and engineering community. He earned two bachelor’s degrees at MIT in computer science and engineering and mathematics, as well as a master’s in engineering in computer science. While at the Institute, Spector published machine-learning research at conferences and presented work on computational plasma physics at an annual meeting of the American Physical Society’s Division of Plasma Physics. He also started a nonprofit startup accelerator, Prod, whose cohort companies raised $25 million under his leadership.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beatriz Yankelevich &lt;/strong&gt;is a doctoral student at MIT in the Engineering Quantum Systems Group, researching waveguide quantum electrodynamics with the goal of developing a modular quantum computing architecture. She is also deeply interested in science policy and outreach and hopes to pursue a career in academia focused on quantum computing research. A graduate of Stanford University, Yankelevich majored in engineering physics with a concentration in quantum science and engineering. Four years ago, as an undergraduate, she founded the Stanford Program for Inspiring the Next Generation of Women in Physics, a free, virtual summer program for high-school-age women from underrepresented backgrounds in physics. During the program, students learn Python and are introduced to modern physics research topics by Stanford students and professors.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;How will advances in computing transform human society?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT students contemplated this impending question as part of the &lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/cross-cutting/social-and-ethical-responsibilities-of-computing/envisioning-the-future-of-computing-prize-2023/" target="_blank"&gt;Envisioning the Future of Computing Prize&lt;/a&gt; — an essay contest in which they were challenged to imagine ways that computing technologies could improve our lives, as well as the pitfalls and dangers associated with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offered for the first time this year, the Institute-wide competition invited MIT undergraduate and graduate students to share their ideas, aspirations, and vision for what they think a future propelled by advancements in computing holds. Nearly 60 students put pen to paper, including those majoring in mathematics, philosophy, electrical engineering and computer science, brain and cognitive sciences, chemical engineering, urban studies and planning, and management, and entered their submissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students dreamed up highly inventive scenarios for how the technologies of today and tomorrow could impact society, for better or worse. Some recurring themes emerged, such as tackling issues in climate change and health care. Others proposed ideas for particular technologies that ranged from digital twins as a tool for navigating the deluge of information online to a cutting-edge platform powered by artificial intelligence, machine learning, and biosensors to create personalized storytelling films that help individuals understand themselves and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceived of by the &lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/cross-cutting/social-and-ethical-responsibilities-of-computing/" target="_blank"&gt;Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing&lt;/a&gt; (SERC), a cross-cutting initiative of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing in collaboration with the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (SHASS), the intent of the competition was “to create a space for students to think in a creative, informed, and rigorous way about the societal benefits and costs of the technologies they are or will be developing,” says Caspar Hare, professor of philosophy, co-associate dean of SERC, and the lead organizer of the Envisioning the Future of Computing Prize. “We also wanted to convey that MIT values such thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prize winners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contest implemented a two-stage evaluation process wherein all essays were reviewed anonymously by a panel of MIT faculty members from the college and SHASS for the initial round. Three qualifiers were then invited to present their entries at an awards ceremony on May 8, followed by a Q&amp;amp;A with a judging panel and live in-person audience for the final round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Tokens-From-Tomorrow.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;winning entry&lt;/a&gt; was awarded to Robert Cunningham '23, a recent graduate in math and physics, for his paper on the implications of a personalized language model that is fine-tuned to predict an individual’s writing based on their past texts and emails. Told from the perspective of three fictional characters: Laura, founder of the tech startup ScribeAI, and Margaret and Vincent, a couple in college who are frequent users of the platform, readers gained insights into the societal shifts that take place and the unforeseen repercussions of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cunningham, who took home the grand prize of $10,000, says he came up with the concept for his essay in late January while thinking about the upcoming release of GPT-4 and how it might be applied. Created by the developers of ChatGPT — an AI chatbot that has managed to capture popular imagination for its capacity to imitate human-like text, images, audio, and code — GPT-4, which was unveiled in March, is the newest version of OpenAI’s language model systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“GPT-4 is wild in reality, but some rumors before it launched were even wilder, and I had a few long&amp;nbsp;plane rides to&amp;nbsp;think about them! I enjoyed this opportunity to solidify a vague notion into a piece of writing, and since some of my favorite works of science fiction are short stories, I figured I'd take the chance to write one,” Cunningham says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other two finalists, awarded $5,000 each, included Gabrielle Kaili-May Liu '23, a recent graduate in mathematics with computer science, and brain and cognitive sciences, for &lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Transforming-Human-Interactions-with-AI-via-Reinforcement-Learning-with-Human-Feedback-RLHF.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;her entry&lt;/a&gt; on using the reinforcement learning with human feedback technique as a tool for transforming human interactions with AI; and Abigail Thwaites and Eliot Matthew Watkins, graduate students in the Department of Philosophy and Linguistics, for their &lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/The-Future-of-Fact-Checking.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;joint submission&lt;/a&gt; on automatic fact checkers, an AI-driven software that they argue could potentially help mitigate the spread of misinformation and be a profound social good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We were so excited to see the amazing response to this contest. It made clear how much students at MIT, contrary to stereotype, really care about the wider implications of technology, says Daniel Jackson, professor of computer science and one of the final-round judges. “So many of the essays were incredibly thoughtful and creative. Robert’s story was a chilling, but entirely plausible take on our AI future; Abigail and Eliot’s analysis brought new clarity to what harms misinformation actually causes; and Gabrielle’s piece gave a lucid overview of a prominent new technology. I hope we’ll be able to run this contest every year, and that it will encourage all our students to broaden their perspectives even further.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fellow judge Graham Jones, professor of anthropology, adds: “The winning entries reflected the incredible breadth of our students’ engagement with socially responsible computing. They challenge us to think differently about how to design computational technologies, conceptualize social impacts, and imagine future scenarios. Working with a cross-disciplinary panel of judges catalyzed lots of new conversations. As a sci-fi fan, I was thrilled that the top prize went to a such a stunning piece of speculative fiction!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other judges on the panel for the final round included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Dan Huttenlocher, dean of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Aleksander Madry, Cadence Design Systems Professor of Computer Science;&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Agustin Rayo, dean of the MIT School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honorable mentions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the grand prize winner and runners up, 12 students were recognized with honorable mentions for their entries, with each receiving $500.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>New model offers a way to speed up drug discovery</title>

  <description><![CDATA[By applying a language model to protein-drug interactions, researchers can quickly screen large libraries of potential drug compounds.]]></description>
  <pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2023 15:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2023/new-model-offers-speedy-drug-discovery-0608</guid>
        <dc:creator>Anne Trafton | MIT News Office</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Huge libraries of drug compounds may hold potential treatments for a variety of diseases, such as cancer or heart disease. Ideally, scientists would like to experimentally test each of these compounds against all possible targets, but doing that kind of screen is prohibitively time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, researchers have begun using computational methods to screen those libraries in hopes of speeding up drug discovery. However, many of those methods also take a long time, as most of them calculate each target protein’s three-dimensional structure from its amino-acid sequence, then use those structures to predict which drug molecules it will interact with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at MIT and Tufts University have now devised an alternative computational approach based on a type of artificial intelligence algorithm known as a large language model. These models — one well-known example is ChatGPT — can analyze huge amounts of text and figure out which words (or, in this case, amino acids) are most likely to appear together. The new model, known as ConPLex, can match target proteins with potential drug molecules without having to perform the computationally intensive step of calculating the molecules’ structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this method, the researchers can screen more than 100 million compounds in a single day — much more than any existing model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This work addresses the need for efficient and accurate&amp;nbsp;in silico screening of potential drug candidates, and the scalability of the model enables large-scale screens for assessing off-target effects, drug repurposing, and determining the impact of mutations on drug binding,” says Bonnie Berger, the Simons Professor of Mathematics, head of the Computation and Biology group in MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), and one of the senior authors of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lenore Cowen, a professor of computer science at Tufts University, is also a senior author of the &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2220778120" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, which appears this week in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;. Rohit Singh, a CSAIL research scientist, and Samuel Sledzieski, an MIT graduate student, are the lead authors of the paper, and Bryan Bryson, an associate professor of biological engineering at MIT and a member of the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard, is also an author. In addition to the paper, the researchers have made their model &lt;a href="https://cb.csail.mit.edu/cb/conplex/" target="_blank"&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt; for other scientists to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making predictions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, computational scientists have made great advances in developing models that can predict the structures of proteins based on their amino-acid sequences. However, using these models to predict how a large library of potential drugs might interact with a cancerous protein, for example, has proven challenging, mainly because calculating the three-dimensional structures of the proteins requires a great deal of time and computing power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional obstacle is that these kinds of models don’t have a good track record for eliminating compounds known as decoys, which are very similar to a successful drug but don’t actually interact well with the target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One of the longstanding challenges in the field has been that these methods are fragile, in the sense that if I gave the model a drug or a small molecule that looked almost like the true thing, but it was slightly different in some subtle way, the model might still predict that they will interact, even though it should not,” Singh says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have designed models that can overcome this kind of fragility, but they are usually tailored to just one class of drug molecules, and they aren’t well-suited to large-scale screens because the computations take too long.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MIT team decided to take an alternative approach, based on &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2019/machine-learning-amino-acids-protein-function-0322" target="_blank"&gt;a protein model&lt;/a&gt; they first developed in 2019. Working with a database of more than 20,000 proteins, the language model encodes this information into meaningful numerical representations&amp;nbsp;of each amino-acid sequence that capture associations between sequence and structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“With these language models, even proteins that have very different sequences but potentially have similar structures or similar functions can be represented in a similar way in this language space, and we're able to take advantage of that to make our predictions,” Sledzieski says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their new study, the researchers applied the protein model to the task of figuring out which protein sequences will interact with specific drug molecules, both of which have numerical representations that are transformed into a common, shared space by a neural network. They trained the network on known protein-drug interactions, which allowed it to learn to associate specific features of the proteins with drug-binding ability, without having to calculate the 3D structure of any of the molecules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“With this high-quality numerical representation, the model can short-circuit the atomic representation entirely, and from these numbers predict whether or not this drug will bind,” Singh says. “The advantage of this is that you avoid the need to go through an atomic representation, but the numbers still have all of the information that you need.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another advantage of this approach is that it takes into account the flexibility of protein structures, which can be “wiggly” and take on slightly different shapes when interacting with a drug molecule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High affinity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make their model less likely to be fooled by decoy drug molecules, the researchers also incorporated a training stage based on the concept of contrastive learning. Under this approach, the researchers give the model examples of “real” drugs and imposters and teach it to distinguish between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers then tested their model by screening a library of about 4,700 candidate drug molecules for their ability to bind to a set of 51 enzymes known as protein kinases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the top hits, the researchers chose 19 drug-protein pairs to test experimentally. The experiments revealed that of the 19 hits, 12 had strong binding affinity (in the nanomolar range), whereas nearly all of the many other possible drug-protein pairs would have no affinity. Four of these pairs bound with extremely high, sub-nanomolar affinity (so strong that a tiny drug concentration, on the order of parts per billion, will inhibit the protein).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the researchers focused mainly on screening small-molecule drugs in this study, they are now working on applying this approach to other types of drugs, such as therapeutic antibodies. This kind of modeling could also prove useful for running toxicity screens of potential drug compounds, to make sure they don’t have any unwanted side effects before testing them in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Part of the reason why drug discovery is so expensive is because it has high failure rates. If we can reduce those failure rates by saying upfront that this drug is not likely to work out, that could go a long way in lowering the cost of drug discovery,” Singh says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new approach “represents a significant breakthrough in drug-target interaction prediction and opens up additional opportunities for future research to further enhance its capabilities,” says Eytan Ruppin, chief of the Cancer Data Science Laboratory at the National Cancer Institute, who was not involved in the study. “For example, incorporating structural information into the latent space or exploring molecular generation methods for generating decoys could further improve predictions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Phillip and Susan Ragon Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Turning a circle into a square is possible with this kirigami-inspired formula </title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2023/kirigami-inspired-formula-shape-shifting-materials-0601</link>
  <description><![CDATA[A study inspired by the Japanese paper-cutting art provides a blueprint for designing shape-shifting materials and devices.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Jennifer Chu | MIT News Office</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Kirigami takes pop-up books to a whole new level. The Japanese paper craft involves cutting patterns in paper to transform a two-dimensional sheet into an intricate, three-dimensional structure when partially folded. In the hands of an artist, kirigami can yield remarkably detailed and delicate replicas of structures in nature, architecture, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists and engineers have also taken inspiration from kirigami, applying principles from paper-cutting to design robotic grippers, stretchable electronics, water-harvesting sheets, and other shape-shifting materials and devices. For the most part, such inventions are products of from-scratch design. There’s been no blueprint for engineers to determine the pattern of cuts that will transform a material from one desired shape to another — that is, until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43588-023-00448-9" target="_blank"&gt;new study in &lt;em&gt;Nature Computational Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; presents a general computational strategy that can solve any two-dimensional, kirigami-inspired transformation. The method can be used to determine the angle and length of cuts to make, such that a sheet can transform from one desired shape to another when pulled open and pushed back together, like an intricate, expandable lattice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With their new method, researchers designed and fabricated a number of transformable, 2D kirigami structures, including a circle that turns into a square, and a triangle that morphs into a heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Multiple blue polygonal shapes rearrange themselves from a triangle to a heart shape, against a black background" data-align="center" data-caption="Credit: Kaitlyn Becker/Gary Choi" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="88894b00-5460-4605-8c6f-fd2e48e416c6" src="/sites/default/files/images/inline/heart_animation2.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People have talked of the square and circle as one of the impossible problems in mathematics: You cannot turn one into the other,” says Gary Choi, a postdoc and instructor in applied mathematics at MIT. “But with kirigami, we can actually turn a square shape into a circle shape.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For engineers, the new method could be used to solve various design problems, such as how a robot can be engineered to transform from one shape to another to carry out a particular task or navigate certain spaces. There’s also potential to design active materials, for instance as smart coverings for buildings and homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One of the first applications we thought of was building façades,” says Kaitlyn Becker, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at MIT. “This could help us to make large, kirigami-like façades that can transform their shape to control sunlight, ultraviolet radiation, and be adaptive to their environment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Becker and Choi are co-authors of the new study, along with Levi Dudte, a quantitative researcher at Optiver, and L. Mahadevan, a professor at Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The space between&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study grew out of the team’s previous work in both kirigami and origami — the Japanese art of paper folding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We found there are a lot of mathematical connections in kirigami and origami,” Choi says. “So we wanted to come up with a mathematical formulation that can help people design a large variety of patterns.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, the team devised an optimization approach for kirigami to find the pattern of cuts that would be required to turn one shape into another. But Choi says the approach was too computationally intensive, and it took a large amount of time to derive an optimal pattern to achieve a particular transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2021, the researchers took on a similar problem in origami and found that through a slightly different perspective, they were able to derive a more efficient strategy. Rather than planning out a pattern of individual folds (similar to kirigami’s individual cuts), the team focused on growing a pattern from a simple folded seed. By working panel by panel, and establishing relationships between panels, such as how one panel would move if an adjacent panel were folded, they were able to derive a relatively efficient algorithm for planning out the design of any origami structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team wondered if a similar approach be applied to kirigami. In traditional kirigami, once cuts have been made in a sheet of paper, the sheet can be partially folded such that the resulting empty spaces create a three-dimensional structure. Like the panels between origami folds, could the empty spaces between cuts, and their relation to each other, yield a more efficient formula for kirigami design? This question motivated the team’s new study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Math links&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study focuses on two-dimensional kirigami transformations. The researchers considered a general kirigami design comprising a mosaic of interconnected quadrilateral tiles, each cut to various angles and sizes. The conceptual mosaic begins as one shape and can be pulled apart and pushed back together to form an entirely new shape. The challenge was to describe how one shape can transform into another, based on the empty spaces between tiles and how the spaces change as the tiles are pulled apart and pushed back together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If the tiles themselves are solid and unchangeable, then it’s the empty spaces between that are an opportunity for motion,” Becker says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team first considered the simplest representation of empty space, in the form of a rhombus, or what they term a “four-bar linkage.” Each side of the rhombus represents a bar, or the edge of a solid tile. Each corner of the rhombus represents a linkage, or hinge that connects tiles. By changing the length and angle of the rhombus’ edges, the team could study how the empty space in between changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By studying progressively larger assemblages of four-bar linkages, the team identified relationships between the angle and length of bars, the shape of individual empty spaces, and the shape of the overall assemblage. They worked these relationships into a general formula, and found that it could efficiently identify the pattern of cuts — including their angle and length — that would be required to transform a two-dimensional sheet from one desired shape to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Without a tool like this, I might brute force this problem in Matlab, or guess and check, but it would take me a very long time to get something that can transform from a circle to a square,” Becker says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In simulations, the team found that the formula could indeed find a pattern of tiles that would turn a circle-shaped mosaic into a square, as well as virtually any shape into any other desired shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going a step further, the team developed two fabrication methods to physically realize the formula’s designs. They quickly realized that a key challenge in making the transformable mosaics was in finding the right material to serve as the tile-connecting hinges. The connections needed to be strong, yet easily bendable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I thought, what is very strong in tension, and tear-resistant, but can have a zero bending radius, almost like a pinpoint hinge?” Becker says. “And the answer, it turns out, is fabric.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team used two methods — 3D printing, and mold casting — to embed small strips of fabric into quadrilateral plastic tiles, in a way that closely connected the tiles while allowing them to bend against each other. Using these two methods, the team fabricated circle-shaped mosaics that transformed into squares, as well as simple triangle mosaics that morphed into more complex heart shapes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We can basically go to any two-dimensional shape,” Choi says. “That’s guaranteed, using our mathematical formulation. Now we’re looking to extend this to 3D kirigami.”&lt;/p&gt;
