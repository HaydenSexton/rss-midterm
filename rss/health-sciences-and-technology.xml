  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Treating severe or chronic injury to soft tissues such as skin and muscle is a challenge in health care. Current treatment methods can be costly and ineffective, and the frequency of chronic wounds in general from conditions such as diabetes and vascular disease, as well as an increasingly aging population, is only expected to rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One promising treatment method involves implanting biocompatible materials seeded with living cells (i.e., microtissue) into the wound. The materials provide a scaffolding for stem cells, or other precursor cells, to grow into the wounded tissue and aid in repair. However, current techniques to construct these scaffolding materials suffer a recurring setback. Human tissue moves and flexes in a unique way that traditional soft materials struggle to replicate, and if the scaffolds stretch, they can also stretch the embedded cells, often causing those cells to die. The dead cells hinder the healing process and can also trigger an inadvertent immune response in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The human body has this hierarchical structure that actually un-crimps or unfolds, rather than stretches," says Steve Gillmer, a researcher in MIT Lincoln Laboratory's Mechanical Engineering Group. "That's why if you stretch your own skin or muscles, your cells aren't dying. What's actually happening is your tissues are uncrimping a little bit before they stretch."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gillmer is part of a multidisciplinary research team that is searching for a solution to this stretching setback. He is working with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/guom@mit.edu"&gt;Professor Ming Guo&lt;/a&gt; from&amp;nbsp;MIT's &lt;a href="https://meche.mit.edu/"&gt;Department of Mechanical Engineering&lt;/a&gt; and the laboratory's&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/about/facilities/defense-fabric-discovery-center"&gt;Defense Fabric Discovery Center&lt;/a&gt; (DFDC) to knit new kinds of fabrics that can uncrimp and move just as human tissue does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea for the collaboration came while Gillmer and Guo were teaching a course at MIT. Guo had been researching how to grow stem cells on new forms of materials that could mimic the uncrimping of natural tissue. He chose electrospun nanofibers, which worked well, but were difficult to fabricate at long lengths, preventing him from integrating the fibers into larger knit structures for larger-scale tissue repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Steve mentioned that Lincoln Laboratory had access to industrial knitting machines," Guo says. These machines allowed him to switch focus to designing larger knits, rather than individual yarns. "We immediately started to test new ideas through internal support from the laboratory."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gillmer and Guo worked with the DFDC to discover which knit patterns could move similarly to different types of soft tissue. They started with three basic knit constructions called interlock, rib, and jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For jersey, think of your T-shirt. When you stretch your shirt, the yarn loops are doing the stretching," says Emily Holtzman, a textile specialist at the DFDC. "The longer the loop length, the more stretch your fabric can accommodate. For ribbed, think of the cuff on your sweater. This fabric construction has a global stretch that allows the fabric to unfold like an accordion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interlock is similar to ribbed but is knitted in a denser pattern and contains twice as much yarn per inch of fabric. By having more yarn, there is more surface area on which to embed the cells. "Knit fabrics can also be designed to have specific porosities, or hydraulic permeability, created by the loops of the fabric and yarn sizes," says Erin Doran, another textile specialist on the team. "These pores can help with the healing process as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, the team has conducted a number of tests embedding mouse embryonic fibroblast cells and mesenchymal stem cells within the different knit patterns and seeing how they behave when the patterns are stretched. Each pattern had variations that affected how much the fabric could uncrimp, in addition to how stiff it became after it started stretching. All showed a high rate of cell survival, and in 2024 the team received an R&amp;amp;D 100 award for their knit designs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gillmer explains that although the project began with treating skin and muscle injuries in mind, their fabrics have the potential to mimic many different types of human soft tissue, such as cartilage or fat. The team recently filed a provisional patent that outlines how to create these patterns and identifies the appropriate materials that should be used to make the yarn. This information can be used as a toolbox to tune different knitted structures to match the mechanical properties of the injured tissue to which they are applied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This project has definitely been a learning experience for me," Gillmer says. "Each branch of this team has a unique expertise, and I think the project would be impossible without them all working together. Our collaboration as a whole enables us to expand the scope of the work to solve these larger, more complex problems."&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Designing better ways to deliver drugs</title>

  <description><![CDATA[Graduate student and MathWorks Fellow Louis DeRidder is developing a device to make chemotherapy dosing more accurate for individual patients.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When Louis DeRidder was 12 years old, he had a medical emergency that nearly cost him his life. The terrifying experience gave him a close-up look at medical care and made him eager to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can’t always pinpoint exactly what gets you interested in something, but that was a transformative moment,” says DeRidder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In high school, he grabbed the chance to participate in a medicine-focused program, spending about half of his days during his senior year in high school learning about medical science and shadowing doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeRidder was hooked. He became fascinated by the technologies that make treatments possible and was particularly interested in how drugs are delivered to the brain, a curiosity that sparked a lifelong passion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Here I was, a 17-year-old in high school, and a decade later, that problem still fascinates me,” he says. “That’s what eventually got me into the drug delivery field.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeRidder’s interests led him to transfer half-way through his undergraduate studies to Johns Hopkins University, where he performed research he had proposed in a Goldwater Scholarship proposal. The research focused on the development of a nanoparticle-drug conjugate to deliver a drug to brain cells in order to transform them from a pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Such a technology could be valuable in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, DeRidder entered the joint Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology program, where he has embarked on a somewhat different type of drug delivery project — developing a device that measures the concentration of a chemotherapy drug in the blood while it is being administered and adjusts the infusion rate so the concentration is optimal for the patient. The system is known as CLAUDIA, or Closed-Loop AUtomated Drug Infusion RegulAtor, and can allow for the personalization of drug dosing for a variety of different drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project stemmed from discussions with his faculty advisors — Robert Langer, the David H. Koch Institute Professor, and Giovanni Traverso, the Karl Van Tassel Career Development Professor and a gastroenterologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. They explained to him that chemotherapy dosing is based on a formula developed in 1916 that estimates a patient’s body surface area. The formula doesn’t consider important influences such as differences in body composition and metabolism, or circadian fluctuations that can affect how a drug interacts with a patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once my advisors presented the reality of how chemotherapies are dosed,” DeRidder says, “I thought, ‘This is insane. How is this the clinical reality?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and his advisors agreed this was a great project for his PhD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After they gave me the problem statement, we began to brainstorm ways that we could develop a medical device to improve the lives of patients” DeRidder says, adding, “I love starting with a blank piece of paper and then brainstorming to work out the best solution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost from the start, DeRidder’s research process involved MATLAB and Simulink, developed by the mathematical computer software company MathWorks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“MathWorks and Simulink are key to what we do,” DeRidder says. “They enable us to model the drug pharmacokinetics — how the body distributes and metabolizes the drug. We also model the components of our system with their software. That was especially critical for us in the very early days, because it let us know whether it was even possible to control the concentration of the drug. And since then, we’ve continuously improved the control algorithm, using these simulations. You simulate hundreds of different experiments before performing any experiments in the lab.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his innovative use of the MATLAB and Simulink tools, DeRidder was awarded MathWorks fellowships both last year and this year. He has also received a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fellowships have been critical to our development of the CLAUDIA drug-delivery system,” DeRidder says, adding that he has “had the pleasure of working with a great team of students and researchers in the lab.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says he would like to move CLAUDIA toward clinical use, where he thinks it could have significant impact. “Whatever I can do to help push it toward the clinic, including potentially helping to start a company to help commercialize the system, I’m definitely interested in doing it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to developing CLAUDIA, DeRidder is working on developing new nanoparticles to deliver therapeutic nucleic acids. The project involves synthesizing new nucleic acid molecules, as well as developing the new polymeric and lipid nanoparticles to deliver the nucleic acids to targeted tissue and cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeRidder says he likes working on technologies at different scales, from medical devices to molecules — all with the potential to improve the practice of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, he finds time in his busy schedule to do community service. For the past three years, he has spent time helping the homeless on Boston streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s easy to lose track of the concrete, simple ways that we can serve our communities when we’re doing research,” DeRidder says, “which is why I have often sought out ways to serve people I come across every day, whether it is a student I mentor in lab, serving the homeless, or helping out the stranger you meet in the store who is having a bad day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, DeRidder says, he’ll head back to work that also recalls his early exposure to the medical field in high school, where he interacted with a lot of people with different types of dementia and other neurological diseases at a local nursing home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My long-term plan includes working on developing devices and molecular therapies to treat neurological diseases, in addition to continuing to work on cancer,” he says. “Really, I’d say that early experience had a big impact on me.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An MIT startup’s personalized heart implants, designed to help prevent strokes, won this year’s MIT Sloan Healthcare Innovation Prize (SHIP) on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spheric Bio’s implants grow inside the body once injected, to fit within the patient’s unique anatomy. This could improve stroke prevention because existing implants are one-size-fits-all devices that can fail to fully block the most at-risk regions, leading to leakages and other complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our mission is to transform stroke prevention by building personalized medical devices directly inside patients’ hearts,” said Connor Verheyen PhD ’23, a postdoc in the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology (HST), who made the winning pitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verheyen’s co-founders are MIT Associate Professor Ellen Roche and HST postdoc Markus Horvath PhD ’22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spheric Bio was one of seven teams that pitched their solution at the event, which was held in the MIT Media Lab and kicked off the MIT Sloan Healthcare and BioInnovations Conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spheric took home the event’s $25,000 first-place prize. The second-place prize went to nurtur, another MIT alumnus-founded startup, that has developed an artificial intelligence-powered platform designed to detect and prevent postpartum depression. Last summer, nurtur participated in the delta v startup accelerator program organized by the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The audience choice award was given to Merunova, which is using AI and MRI diagnostics to improve the diagnosis and treatment of spinal cord disorders. Merunova was co-founded by Dheera Ananthakrishnan, a former spine surgeon who completed an executive MBA from the MIT Sloan School of Management in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalized stroke prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spheric Bio’s first implants aim to solve the problem of atrial fibrillation, a condition that causes areas of the heart to beat irregularly and rapidly, leading to a dramatic increase in stroke risk. The problem begins when blood pools and clots in the heart. Those clots then move to the brain and cause a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a problem I’ve witnessed firsthand in my family,” says Verheyen. “It’s so common that millions of families around the world have had to experience a loved one go through a stroke as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with atrial fibrillation today can either go on blood thinners, in many cases for years or even life, or undergo a procedure in which surgeons insert a device into the heart to close off an area known as the left atrial appendage, where about 90 percent of such originate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implants on the market today for that procedure are typically prefabricated metal devices that don’t account for the wide variations seen in patient heart anatomy. Verheyen says up to half of the devices fail to seal the appendage. They can also lead to complications and complex care pathways designed to manage those shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a fundamental mismatch between the devices available and what human patients actually look like,” says Verheyen. “Humans are infinitely variable in shape and size, and these tissues in particular are really soft, complex, delicate tissues. It leaves you with a pretty profound incompatibility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spheric Bio’s implants are designed to conform to a patient’s anatomy like water filling a glass. The implant is made of biomaterials developed over years of research at MIT. They are delivered through a catheter and then expand and self-heal to custom fit the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This gives us complete closure of the appendage for every patient, every time,” said Verheyen, who has successfully tested the device in animals. “It also allows us to reduce device-related complications and simplifies deployment for operators.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verheyen conducted his PhD work on medical imaging and medical physics in Roche’s lab. Roche is also the associate head of Department of Mechanical Engineering at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovations for impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 23rd annual pitch competition offered anyone interested in health care innovation a look at the promising new solutions being developed at universities. The event is open to all early-stage health care startups with at least one student or recent graduate co-founder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event was the result of a months-long process in which more than 100 applicants were whittled down over the course of three rounds by a group of 20 judges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final competition also kicked off the MIT Sloan Healthcare and BioInnovations Conference, which took place Feb. 27 and 28. This year’s conference was titled From Innovation to Impact: The Changing Face of Healthcare, and featured keynotes with health care industry veterans including Chris Boerner, the CEO of Bristole Myers Squibb, and James Davis, the CEO of Quest Diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The competition’s keynote was delivered by Iterative Health CEO Jonathan Ng, who was a finalist in the competition in 2017. Ng expressed admiration for this year’s contestants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s inspiring to look around and see people who want to change the world,” said Ng, whose company is using cameras and AI to improve colorectal cancer screening. “There’s a lot of easier industries to work in, but MIT is such a good place to find your tribe: to find people who want to make the same sort of impact on the world as you.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Michele David has had a long and varied career in medicine. But, she says, it took coming to MIT nine years ago to find “a job that fully engages all of who I am.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David, a highly accomplished physician, currently serves as chief of clinical quality and patient safety at &lt;a href="https://health.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;MIT Health&lt;/a&gt;, the Institute’s multispecialty group practice and health resource serving the MIT community — including students, faculty, and staff, as well as affiliated families and retirees. While she began her MIT tenure as a primary care provider in 2015, David now focuses on quality improvement projects for the organization. In particular, she developed and now leads the ambulatory safety net team, which is tasked with creating protocols and workflows for completing health screenings of a variety of disorders and diseases, and for managing abnormal test results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of who David is was shaped by the strong women she looked up to during her childhood in Haiti. Her father died when David was just 6 months old, leaving her mother, a young schoolteacher, with four children, the oldest just 5. Despite having many suitors, she never remarried. In Haiti’s patriarchal society, she later told David, marrying again would have yielded all the power in the household to a man, something she did not want her three young daughters to experience. David’s maternal aunt, who graduated from medical school in Haiti in 1956, completed her residency in the United States, and eventually became chief of pathology at the West Side VA Medical Center in Chicago, was another role model for David who nudged her toward a career in medicine. The death of her infant godson from an easily curable diarrheal illness due to the local hospital’s lack of basic medical supplies further strengthened the then-teenage David’s resolve to become someone who could make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David’s passion for public health and health equity grew as she earned her medical degree from the University of Chicago School of Medicine and completed her residency at the New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center in Manhattan. The hospital where she trained was divided into sections for patients who could pay for their care and those who were uninsured. It was also the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, and David saw firsthand how fear of the disease led to bias and discrimination against members of already-marginalized communities. At the time, David was not allowed to donate blood alongside other residents, because she was Haitian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her subsequent career included training and working in pulmonary critical care medicine, teaching medical students, researching health disparities among populations of Caribbean and African American women, and caring for patients, with a focus on women’s health. David also contributes her knowledge and energy to causes close to her heart. She is chair of the board for &lt;a href="https://healthequityintl.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Health Equity International&lt;/a&gt;; an advisor to the &lt;a href="https://rsphealth.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Resilient Sisterhood Project&lt;/a&gt;; and a member of the &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/orgs/public-health-council"&gt;Massachusetts Public Health Council&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2015, disillusioned by what she describes as a combination of “the glass ceiling” and “corporate medicine,” David began planning an early retirement. That’s when a member of the leadership team from MIT Health heard about her plans and gave her a call. “I told him all the reasons I wanted to quit medicine.&amp;nbsp;He said, ‘It won’t be like that at MIT Health. Please come join us.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At MIT Health, David started as a primary care provider before gradually assuming additional administrative responsibilities for clinical quality and patient safety. While still seeing patients, she wrote and received a grant to develop an “ambulatory safety net” for the organization, a system of check-ins and procedures to help ensure that patients receive care that maximizes positive health outcomes. David started by assembling a team to create a safety net for colorectal cancer screening, which identified and contacted patients who were overdue for screenings or at high risk. Within the first year of the project, scheduled or completed colonoscopies among MIT Health patients in these groups increased from 29 to 97 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last spring, David transitioned to a full-time administrative role at MIT Health. Her team recently launched additional safety nets for breast cancer screening and behavioral health and is developing safety nets for prostate cancer and lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as for that early retirement? “I don’t have another 20 years left in me,” David says. “But I’d like to stay at MIT for as long as I can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soundbytes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;How did you make the decision to assume your current, full-time role as chief of clinical quality and patient safety?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;It was a role I already had, but I was doing it part time. I was also caring for a very complex panel of patients. When Chief Health Officer Cecilia Stuopis asked me if I would consider doing it full time, I was somewhat ambivalent, because I’ve always enjoyed taking care of patients. I thought about it and realized that it was another way of doing the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;What do you like about working at MIT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Working at MIT Health feels like the first time I’ve been able to use my entire skill set to do my job. I wear my policy and public health hats when I’m working on ambulatory safety nets. I’m able to mentor&amp;nbsp;and advise students, and I collaborate with my colleagues on patient care. I also feel fully supported by MIT Health’s leadership team. They are truly invested in me, and I feel that my work matters — not only to me and to them, but also to my co-workers and direct reports. Because of this, I am able to bring my best self to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Have you been able to keep up with your many outside projects while working at MIT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. I lecture regularly on medical racism and health-care disparities at conferences and at other institutions. I continue to create and exhibit fine art quilts. Last year, in my role with the Resilient Sisterhood Project and in conjunction with “&lt;a href="https://hutchinscenter.fas.harvard.edu/call-and-response" target="_blank"&gt;Call and Response&lt;/a&gt;,” an exhibition at Harvard University’s Hutchins Center for African and African American Research, I was able to bring a film and panel discussion to campus. The event focused on the “mothers of gynecology,” three enslaved women — Anarcha, Betsey, and Lucy — who were forced to undergo numerous experimental surgeries without anesthesia by J. Marion Sims, the South Carolina doctor long recognized as the “father of gynecology.” This is one of the stories I started telling my medical students in the late 1990s, after one student asked me why African American patients are often so distrustful of health care. This history was not in medical textbooks at that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What are you proudest of so far in your time at MIT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Even though I’m no longer seeing my own patients in person, I’m making systemic changes that are improving health outcomes for the entire panel of patients at MIT Health.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;About 60 percent of all cancer patients in the United States receive radiation therapy as part of their treatment. However, this radiation can have severe side effects that often end up being too difficult for patients to tolerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing inspiration from a tiny organism that can withstand huge amounts of radiation, researchers at MIT, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and the University of Iowa have developed a new strategy that may protect patients from this kind of damage. Their approach makes use of a protein from tardigrades, often also called “water bears,” which are usually less than a millimeter in length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers injected messenger RNA encoding this protein into mice, they found that it generated enough protein to protect cells’ DNA from radiation-induced damage. If developed for use in humans, this approach could benefit many cancer patients, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Radiation can be very helpful for many tumors, but we also recognize that the side effects can be limiting. There’s an unmet need with respect to helping patients mitigate the risk of damaging adjacent tissue,” says Giovanni Traverso, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT and a gastroenterologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traverso and James Byrne, an assistant professor of radiation oncology at the University of Iowa, are the senior authors of the study, which &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01360-5" target="_blank"&gt;appears today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The paper’s lead authors are Ameya Kirtane, an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School and a visiting scientist at MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, and Jianling Bi, a research scientist at the University of Iowa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extreme survival&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radiation is often used to treat cancers of the head and neck, where it can damage the mouth or throat, making it very painful to eat or drink. It is also commonly used for gastrointestinal cancers, which can lead to rectal bleeding. Many patients end up delaying treatments or stopping them altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This affects a huge number of patients, and it can manifest as something as simple as mouth sores, which can limit a person’s ability to eat because it’s so painful, to requiring hospitalization because people are suffering so terribly from the pain, weight loss, or bleeding. It can be pretty dangerous, and it’s something that we really wanted to try and address,” Byrne says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are very few ways to prevent radiation damage in cancer patients. There are a handful of drugs that can be given to try to reduce the damage, and for prostate cancer patients, a hydrogel can be used to create a physical barrier between the prostate and the rectum during radiation treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For several years, Traverso and Byrne have been working on developing new ways to prevent radiation damage. In the new study, they were inspired by the extraordinary survival ability of tardigrades. Found all over the world, usually in aquatic environments, these organisms are well known for their resilience to extreme conditions. Scientists have even sent them into space, where they were shown to survive extreme dehydration and cosmic radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key component of tardigrades’ defense systems is a unique damage suppressor protein called Dsup, which binds to DNA and helps protect it from radiation-induced damage. This protein plays a major role in tardigrades’ ability to survive radiation doses 2,000 to 3,000 times higher than what a human being can tolerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When brainstorming ideas for novel ways to protect cancer patients from radiation, the researchers wondered if they might be able to deliver messenger RNA encoding Dsup to patient tissues before radiation treatment. This mRNA would trigger cells to transiently express the protein, protecting DNA during the treatment. After a few hours, the mRNA and protein would disappear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this to work, the researchers needed a way to deliver mRNA that would generate large amounts of protein in the target tissues. They screened libraries of delivery particles containing both polymer and lipid components, which have been used separately to achieve efficient mRNA delivery. From these screens, they identified one polymer-lipid particle that was best-suited for delivery to the colon, and another that was optimized to deliver mRNA to mouth tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We thought that perhaps by combining these two systems — polymers and lipids — we may be able to get the best of both worlds and get highly potent RNA delivery. And that’s essentially what we saw,” Kirtane says. “One of the strengths of our approach is that we are using a messenger RNA, which just temporarily expresses the protein, so it’s considered far safer than something like DNA, which may be incorporated into the cells’ genome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protection from radiation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After showing that these particles could successfully deliver mRNA to cells grown in the lab, the researchers tested whether this approach could effectively protect tissue from radiation in a mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They injected the particles into either the cheek or the rectum several hours before giving a dose of radiation similar to what cancer patients would receive. In these mice, the researchers saw a 50 percent reduction in the amount of double-stranded DNA breaks caused by radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study shows great promise and is a really novel idea leveraging natural mechanisms of protection again DNA damage for the purpose of protecting healthy cells during radiation treatments for cancer,” says Ben Ho Park, director of the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also showed that the protective effect of the Dsup protein did not spread beyond the injection site, which is important because they don’t want to protect the tumor itself from the effects of radiation. To make this treatment more feasible for potential use in humans, the researchers now plan to work on developing a version of the Dsup protein that would not provoke an immune response, as the original tardigrade protein likely would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If developed for use in humans, this protein could also potentially be used to protect against DNA damage caused by chemotherapy drugs, the researchers say. Another possible application would be to help prevent radiation damage in astronauts in space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other authors of the paper include Netra Rajesh, Chaoyang Tang, Miguel Jimenez, Emily Witt, Megan McGovern, Arielle Cafi, Samual Hatfield, Lauren Rosenstock, Sarah Becker, Nicole Machado, Veena Venkatachalam, Dylan Freitas, Xisha Huang, Alvin Chan, Aaron Lopes, Hyunjoon Kim, Nayoon Kim, Joy Collins, Michelle Howard, Srija Manchkanti, and Theodore Hong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the Prostate Cancer Foundation Young Investigator Award, the U.S. Department of Defense Prostate Cancer Program Early Investigator Award, a Hope Funds for Cancer Research Fellowship, the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute, MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering, and the U.S. Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rain can freefall at speeds of up to 25 miles per hour. If the droplets land in a puddle or pond, they can form a crown-like splash that, with enough force, can dislodge any surface particles and launch them into the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now MIT scientists have taken high-speed videos of droplets splashing into a deep pool, to track how the fluid evolves, above and below the water line, frame by millisecond frame. Their work could help to predict how spashing droplets, such as from rainstorms and irrigation systems, may impact watery surfaces and aerosolize surface particles, such as pollen on puddles or pesticides in agricultural runoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team carried out experiments in which they dispensed water droplets of various sizes and from various heights into a pool of water. Using high-speed imaging, they measured how the liquid pool deformed as the impacting droplet hit the pool’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all their experiments, they observed a common splash evolution: As a droplet hit the pool, it pushed down below the surface to form a “crater,” or cavity. At nearly the same time, a wall of liquid rose above the surface, forming a crown. Interestingly, the team observed that small, secondary droplets were ejected from the crown before the crown reached its maximum height. This entire evolution happens in a fraction of a second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have caught snapshots of droplet splashes in the past, such as the famous “&lt;a href="https://mitmuseum.mit.edu/collections/object/HEE-NC-57001" target="_blank"&gt;Milk Drop Coronet&lt;/a&gt;” — a photo of a drop of milk in mid-splash, taken by the late MIT professor Harold “Doc” Edgerton, who invented a photographic technique to capture quickly moving objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new work represents the first time scientists have used such high-speed images to model the entire splash dynamics of a droplet in a deep pool, combining what happens both above and below the surface. The team has used the imaging to gather new data central to build a mathematical model that predicts how a droplet’s shape will morph and merge as it hits a pool’s surface. They plan to use the model as a baseline to explore to what extent a splashing droplet might drag up and launch particles from the water pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Impacts of drops on liquid layers are ubiquitous,”&amp;nbsp;says study author Lydia Bourouiba, a professor in the MIT departments of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Mechanical Engineering, and a core member of the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES). “Such impacts can produce myriads of secondary droplets that could&amp;nbsp;act as carriers for pathogens, particles, or microbes that are on the surface of impacted pools or contaminated water bodies. This work is key in enabling prediction of droplet size distributions, and potentially&amp;nbsp;also what such drops can carry with them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bourouiba and her mentees have &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/splash-on-a-liquid-pool-coupled-cavitysheet-unsteady-dynamics/1DC718032999AE56714953CD0B52B60F" target="_blank"&gt;published their results in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Fluid Mechanics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. MIT co-authors include former graduate student Raj Dandekar PhD ’22, postdoc (Eric) Naijian Shen, and student mentee Boris Naar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Above and below&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At MIT, Bourouiba heads up the Fluid Dynamics of Disease Transmission Laboratory, part of the Fluids and Health Network, where she and her team explore the fundamental physics of fluids and droplets in a range of environmental, energy, and health contexts, including disease transmission. For their new study, the team looked to better understand how droplets impact a deep pool — a seemingly simple phenomenon that nevertheless has been tricky to precisely capture and characterize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bourouiba notes that there have been recent breakthroughs in modeling the evolution of a splashing droplet below a pool’s surface. As a droplet hits a pool of water, it breaks through the surface and drags air down through the pool to create a short-lived crater. Until now, scientists have focused on the evolution of this underwater cavity, mainly for applications in energy harvesting. What happens above the water, and how a droplet’s crown-like shape evolves with the cavity below, remained less understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The descriptions and understanding of what happens below the surface, and above, have remained very much divorced,” says Bourouiba, who believes such an understanding can help to predict how droplets launch and spread chemicals, particles, and microbes&amp;nbsp;into the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Splash in 3D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To study the coupled dynamics between a droplet’s cavity and crown, the team set up an experiment to dispense water droplets into a deep pool. For the purposes of their study, the researchers considered a deep pool to be a body of water that is deep enough that a splashing droplet would remain far away from the pool’s bottom. In these terms, they found that a pool with a depth of at least 20 centimeters was sufficient for their experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They varied each droplet’s size, with an average diameter of about 5 millimeters. They also dispensed droplets from various heights, causing the droplets to hit the pool’s surface at different speeds, which on average was about 5 meters per second. The overall dynamics, Bourouiba says, should be similar to what occurs on the surface of a puddle or pond during an average rainstorm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is capturing the speed at which raindrops fall,” she says. “These wouldn’t be very small, misty drops. This would be rainstorm drops for which one needs an umbrella.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using high-speed imaging techniques inspired by Edgerton’s pioneering photography, the team captured videos of pool-splashing droplets, at rates of up to 12,500 frames per second. They then applied in-house imaging processing methods to extract key measurements from the image sequences, such as the changing width and depth of the underwater cavity, and the evolving diameter and height of the rising crown. The researchers also captured especially tricky measurements, of the crown’s wall thickness profile and inner flow — the cylinder that rises out of the pool, just before it forms a rim and points that are characteristic of a crown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This cylinder-like wall of rising liquid, and how it evolves in time and space, is at the heart of everything,” Bourouiba says. “It’s what connects the fluid from the pool to what will go into the rim and then be ejected into the air through smaller, secondary droplets.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers worked the image data into a set of “evolution equations,” or a mathematical model that relates the various properties of an&amp;nbsp;impacting droplet, such as the width of its cavity and the thickness and speed profiles of its crown wall, and how these properties change over time, given a droplet’s starting size and impact speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We now have a closed-form mathematical expression that people can use to see how all these quantities of a splashing droplet change over space and time,” says co-author Shen, who plans, with Bourouiba, to apply the new model to the behavior of secondary droplets and understanding how a splash end-up dispersing particles such as pathogens and pesticides. “This opens up the possibility to study all these problems of splash in 3D, with self-contained closed-formed equations, which was not possible before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was supported, in part, by&amp;nbsp;the Department of Agriculture-National Institute of Food and Agriculture Specialty Crop Research Initiative; the Richard and Susan Smith Family Foundation; the National Science Foundation; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health; Inditex; and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

She is affiliated with the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS),&amp;nbsp;the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab,&amp;nbsp;the Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health, the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS), and CSAIL. Ghassemi’s research in the Healthy ML Group creates a rigorous quantitative framework in which to design, develop, and place&amp;nbsp;machine learning models in a way that is robust and useful, focusing on health settings. Her contributions range from socially-aware model construction to improving subgroup- and shift-robust learning methods to identifying important insights in model deployment scenarios that have implications in policy, health practice, and equity. Among other awards, Ghassemi has been named one of &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;’s 35 Innovators Under 35 and an AI2050 Fellow, as well as receiving the 2018 Seth J. Teller Award, the 2023 MIT Prize for Open Data, a 2024 NSF CAREER Award, and the Google Research Scholar Award. She founded the nonprofit Association for Health, Inference and Learning (AHLI) and her work has been featured in popular press such as &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;MIT News&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cee.mit.edu/people_individual/darcy-mcrose/"&gt;Darcy McRose&lt;/a&gt; is the Thomas D. and Virginia W. Cabot Career Development Assistant Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering. She is an environmental microbiologist who&amp;nbsp;draws on techniques from genetics, chemistry, and geosciences to understand the ways microbes control nutrient cycling and plant health.&amp;nbsp;Her laboratory uses small molecules, or “secondary metabolites,” made by plants and microbes as tractable experiments tools to study microbial activity in complex environments like soils and sediments. In the long term, this work aims to uncover fundamental controls on microbial physiology and community assembly that can be used to promote&amp;nbsp;agricultural sustainability, ecosystem health, and human prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/sarah-millholland/"&gt;Sarah Millholland&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of physics at MIT and member of the&amp;nbsp;Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research,&amp;nbsp;is a theoretical astrophysicist who studies extrasolar planets, including their formation and evolution, orbital dynamics, and interiors/atmospheres. She studies patterns in the observed planetary orbital architectures, referring to properties like the spacings, eccentricities, inclinations, axial tilts, and planetary size relationships. She specializes in investigating how gravitational interactions such as tides, resonances, and spin dynamics sculpt observable exoplanet properties.&amp;nbsp;She is the 2024 recipient of the&amp;nbsp;Vera Rubin Early Career Award for her&amp;nbsp;contributions to the formation and dynamics of extrasolar planetary systems.&amp;nbsp;She plans to use her Sloan Fellowship to explore how tidal physics shape the diversity of orbits and interiors of exoplanets orbiting close to their stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/emil-verner"&gt;Emil Verner&lt;/a&gt; is the Albert F. (1942) and Jeanne P. Clear Career Development Associate Professor of Global Management and an associate professor of finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management. His research lies at the intersection of finance and macroeconomics, with a particular focus on understanding the causes and consequences of financial crises over the past 150 years. Verner’s recent work examines the drivers of bank runs and insolvency during banking crises, the role of debt booms in amplifying macroeconomic fluctuations, the effectiveness of debt relief policies during crises, and how financial crises impact political polarization and support for populist parties. Before joining MIT, he earned a PhD in economics from Princeton University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/christian-wolf"&gt;Christian Wolf&lt;/a&gt;, the Rudi Dornbusch Career Development Assistant Professor of Economics and a faculty research fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research, works in macroeconomics, monetary economics, and time series econometrics. His work focuses on the development and application of new empirical methods to address classic macroeconomic questions and to evaluate how robust the answers are to a range of common modeling assumptions. His research has provided path-breaking insights on monetary transmission mechanisms and fiscal policy. In a separate strand of work, Wolf has substantially deepened our understanding of the appropriate methods macroeconomists should use to estimate impulse response functions — how key economic variables respond to policy changes or unexpected shocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The following MIT alumni also received fellowships:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jason Altschuler SM ’18, PhD ’22&lt;br&gt;David Bau III PhD ’21&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Rene Boiteau PhD ’16&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Lynne Chantranupong PhD ’17&lt;br&gt;Lydia B.

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Biology is never simple. As researchers make strides in reading and editing genes to treat disease, for instance, a growing body of evidence suggests that the proteins and metabolites surrounding those genes can’t be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT spinout ReviveMed has created a platform for measuring metabolites — products of metabolism like lipids, cholesterol, sugar, and carbs — at scale. The company is using those measurements to uncover why some patients respond to treatments when others don’t and to better understand the drivers of disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Historically, we’ve been able to measure a few hundred metabolites with high accuracy, but that’s a fraction of the metabolites that exist in our bodies,” says ReviveMed CEO Leila Pirhaji PhD ’16, who founded the company with Professor Ernest Fraenkel. “There’s a massive gap between what we’re accurately measuring and what exists in our body, and that’s what we want to tackle. We want to tap into the powerful insights from underutilized metabolite data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ReviveMed’s progress comes as the broader medical community is increasingly linking dysregulated metabolites to diseases like cancer, Alzheimer’s, and cardiovascular disease. ReviveMed is using its platform to help some of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world find patients that stand to benefit from their treatments. It’s also offering software to academic researchers for free to help gain insights from untapped metabolite data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With the field of AI booming, we think we can overcome data problems that have limited the study of metabolites,” Pirhaji says. “There’s no foundation model for metabolomics, but we see how these models are changing various fields such as genomics, so we’re starting to pioneer their development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding a challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pirhaji was born and raised in Iran before coming to MIT in 2010 to pursue her PhD in biological engineering. She had previously read Fraenkel’s research papers and was excited to contribute to the network models he was building, which integrated data from sources like genomes, proteomes, and other molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were thinking about the big picture in terms of what you can do when you can measure everything — the genes, the RNA, the proteins, and small molecules like metabolites and lipids,” says Fraenkel, who currently serves on ReviveMed’s board of directors. “We’re probably only able to measure something like 0.1 percent of small molecules in the body. We thought there had to be a way to get as comprehensive a view of those molecules as we have for the other ones. That would allow us to map out all of the changes occurring in the cell, whether it's in the context of cancer or development or degenerative diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About halfway through her PhD, Pirhaji sent some samples to a collaborator at Harvard University to collect data on the metabolome — the small molecules that are the products of metabolic processes. The collaborator sent Pirhaji back a huge excel sheet with&amp;nbsp;thousands of lines of data — but they told her she’s better off ignoring everything beyond the top 100 rows because they had no idea what the other data meant. She took that as a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I started thinking maybe we could use our network models to solve this problem,” Pirhaji recalls. “There was a lot of ambiguity in the data, and it was very interesting to me because no one had tried this before. It seemed like a big gap in the field.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pirhaji developed a huge knowledge graph that included millions of interactions between proteins and metabolites. The data was rich but messy — Pirhaji called it a “hair ball” that couldn’t tell researchers anything about disease. To make it more useful, she created a new way to characterize metabolic pathways and features. In a 2016 paper in &lt;em&gt;Nature Methods&lt;/em&gt;, she described the system and used it to analyze metabolic changes in a model of Huntington’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, Pirhaji had no intention of starting a company, but she started realizing the technology’s commercial potential in the final years of her PhD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no entrepreneurial culture in Iran,” Pirhaji says. “I didn’t know how to start a company or turn science into a startup, so I leveraged everything MIT offered.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pirhaji began taking classes at the MIT Sloan School of Management, including Course 15.371 (Innovation Teams), where she teamed up with classmates to think about how to apply her technology. She also used the MIT Venture Mentoring Service and MIT Sandbox, and took part in the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship’s delta v startup accelerator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Pirhaji and Fraenkel officially founded ReviveMed, they worked with MIT’s Technology Licensing Office to access the patents around their work. Pirhaji has since further developed the platform to solve other problems she discovered from talks with hundreds of leaders in pharmaceutical companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ReviveMed began by working with hospitals to uncover how lipids are dysregulated in a disease known as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis.&amp;nbsp;In 2020, ReviveMed worked with Bristol Myers Squibb to predict how subsets of cancer patients would respond to the company’s immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, ReviveMed has worked with several companies, including four of the top 10 global pharmaceutical companies, to help them understand the metabolic mechanisms behind their treatments. Those insights help identify the patients that stand to benefit the most from different therapies more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we know which patients will benefit from every drug, it would really decrease the complexity and time associated with clinical trials,” Pirhaji says. “Patients will get the right treatments faster.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generative models for metabolomics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, ReviveMed collected a dataset based on 20,000 patient blood samples that it used to create digital twins of patients and generative AI models for metabolomics research. ReviveMed is making its generative models available to nonprofit academic researchers, which could accelerate our understanding of how metabolites influence a range of diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re democratizing the use of metabolomic data,” Pirhaji says. “It’s impossible for us to have data from every single patient in the world, but our digital twins can be used to find patients that could benefit from treatments based on their demographics, for instance, by finding patients that could be at risk of cardiovascular disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work is part of ReviveMed’s mission to create metabolic foundation models that researchers and pharmaceutical companies can use to understand how diseases and treatments change the metabolites of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Leila solved a lot of really hard problems you face when you’re trying to take an idea out of the lab and turn it into something that’s robust and reproducible enough to be deployed in biomedicine,” Fraenkel says. “Along the way, she also realized the software that she’s developed is incredibly powerful by itself and could be transformational.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the fast-changing world of biotechnology, engineers need more than technical expertise — they need the ability to collaborate across disciplines, tackle complex problems, and define the challenges of tomorrow. That’s the mission of MIT’s class 20.051 (Introduction to NEET: Living Machines), a course within the New Engineering Education Transformation (NEET) program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The course offers undergraduates a sweeping introduction to the life sciences and biotech industry, equipping them with design, simulation, and experimental methods while fostering the interdisciplinary mindset needed for success. “Probably the most valuable aspect of 20.051,” says chemical-biological engineering major Grace Yang, “was the breadth of topics introduced. The life sciences/biotech industry is incredibly varied, but it’s sometimes hard to learn what the different paths are, especially if you’re just starting out. Being introduced to different fields — synthetic biology, immunology, etc. — definitely helps with exposure to different possibilities.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yang adds, “On the more technical side, there are skills like CAD or microfluidics design that I definitely wouldn’t have learned without the class.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The School of Engineering launched the NEET program in 2017 to prepare undergraduates for the increasingly interdisciplinary environment of real-world work and research. Students start as sophomores in one of four areas of concentration or “threads” — Autonomous Machines, Climate and Sustainability Systems, Digital Cities, and Living Machines — and complete a three-year certificate program emphasizing hands-on learning and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Living Machines thread, 20.051 stands out for helping students navigate and integrate insights from multiple disciplines. According to Mehdi Salek, a NEET lecturer and the course’s lead instructor, “The main objectives in designing 20.051 was to develop an interdisciplinary mindset and to equip students with essential engineering and communication skills for tackling challenges in biomedical engineering and biotechnology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salek points out that mechanical engineering students, for instance, gain valuable opportunities to learn the language and foundational concepts of biology and chemistry. Meanwhile, students from life sciences disciplines expand their expertise by developing design and technical skills, creating a well-rounded, interdisciplinary learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The course introduces key topic design and fabrication methods, basic simulation techniques, problem-solving skills, and experimental design, says Salek, “all of which are critical for tackling complex biomedical challenges,” such as developing new treatment strategies to combat human disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A hallmark of 20.051,” says Linda Griffith, the NEET Living Machines founding faculty lead and School of Engineering Professor of Teaching Innovation, is teaching students one of the most challenging skills: “mastering the art of problem definition.” “We guide them to ask critical questions, like: What is the state of the art in the field? What would represent a giant leap forward? Can a single step accelerate progress across the field? Are new engineering approaches the key to transformational change where tools are currently insufficient?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We provide students with a graphic apprenticeship in the problem definition process,” Griffith says, “and set them up to solve the problems in their research immersions if they wish.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biological engineering major Zixuan Liu says one way in which 20.051 stood out from other classes is in its emphasis on hands-on projects. Working on an interdisciplinary team that included a chemical-biological engineering major and a computer science and molecular biology major, Liu helped design a microfluidics device, or “organ on a chip.” Such devices generally use living cells or tissue that are combined with other living components or chemical agents to replicate and experiment with interactions that can occur in the body. Liu’s team designed a device to model bone marrow. Its intended function was to replicate hematopoiesis — the development and differentiation of blood cells — in a miniature, controlled environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computer science and engineering major Danny Antonelli says that through his 20.051 microfluidics project — which was designed to grow pain neurons in a diabetic medium in order to simulate diabetic neuropathy — “we got experience with simulation software, literature review, design software, 3D printing, and bio lab work, none of which I had done in a class before. And that was just for one of our projects!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the class, students have significant opportunities to network, connect with researchers in different disciplines, and become part of a diverse, interdisciplinary community. “The guest lecturers are often PIs [principal investigators] of different labs throughout MIT. It was really helpful to hear their research firsthand, and we had the chance to introduce ourselves after class,” Antonelli says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This term, 20.051 students are collaborating with Griffith’s lab to investigate the role of Fusobacterium nucleatum in endometriosis, while other students are working with Bryan Bryson, the Phillip and Susan Ragon Career Development Professor in the Department of Biological Engineering, to address limitations in tuberculosis research. Bryson’s students are designing human microphysiological models to explore early infection responses, offering alternatives to traditional mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The emphasis on interdisciplinary thinking and collaboration, and exposure to emerging technologies, push students to develop new skills and expand their perspectives,” Salek says. “This helps them to gain confidence in their ability to navigate complex challenges, communicate effectively across fields and disciplines, and pursue innovative solutions, which has a lasting effect on their academic and professional growth.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Proteins are the workhorses that keep our cells running, and there are many thousands of types of proteins in our cells, each performing a specialized function. Researchers have long known that the structure of a protein determines what it can do. More recently, researchers are coming to appreciate that a protein’s localization is also critical for its function. Cells are full of compartments that help to organize their many denizens. Along with the well-known organelles that adorn the pages of biology textbooks, these spaces also include a variety of dynamic, membrane-less compartments that concentrate certain molecules together to perform shared functions. Knowing where a given protein localizes, and who it co-localizes with, can therefore be useful for better understanding that protein and its role in the healthy or diseased cell, but researchers have lacked a systematic way to predict this information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, protein structure has been studied for over half-a-century, culminating in the artificial intelligence tool AlphaFold, which can predict protein structure from a protein’s amino acid code,&amp;nbsp;the linear string of building blocks within it that folds to create its structure. AlphaFold and models like it have become widely used tools in research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proteins also contain regions of amino acids that do not fold into a fixed structure, but are instead important for helping proteins join dynamic compartments in the cell. MIT Professor Richard Young and colleagues wondered whether the code in those regions could be used to predict protein localization in the same way that other regions are used to predict structure. Other researchers have discovered some protein sequences that code for protein localization, and some have begun developing predictive models for protein localization. However, researchers did not know whether a protein’s localization to any dynamic compartment could be predicted based on its sequence, nor did they have a comparable tool to AlphaFold for predicting localization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Young, also member of the Whitehead Institute for Biological Research; Young lab postdoc Henry Kilgore; Regina Barzilay, the School of Engineering Distinguished Professor for AI and Health in MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and principal investigator in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL); and colleagues have built such a model, which they call ProtGPS. In a paper published on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adq2634"&gt;Feb. 6 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with first authors Kilgore and Barzilay lab graduate students Itamar Chinn, Peter Mikhael, and Ilan Mitnikov, the cross-disciplinary team debuts their model. The researchers show that ProtGPS can predict to which of 12 known types of compartments a protein will localize, as well as whether a disease-associated mutation will change that localization. Additionally, the research team developed a generative algorithm that can design novel proteins to localize to specific compartments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My hope is that this is a first step towards a powerful platform that enables people studying proteins to do their research,” Young says, “and that it helps us understand how humans develop into the complex organisms that they are, how mutations disrupt those natural processes, and how to generate therapeutic hypotheses and design drugs to treat dysfunction in a cell.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also validated many of the model’s predictions with experimental tests in cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It really excited me to be able to go from computational design all the way to trying these things in the lab,” Barzilay says. “There are a lot of exciting papers in this area of AI, but 99.9 percent of those never get tested in real systems. Thanks to our collaboration with the Young lab, we were able to test, and really learn how well our algorithm is doing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h6&gt;Developing the model&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers trained and tested ProtGPS on two batches of proteins with known localizations. They found that it could correctly predict where proteins end up with high accuracy. The researchers also tested how well ProtGPS could predict changes in protein localization based on disease-associated mutations within a protein. Many mutations — changes to the sequence for a gene and its corresponding protein — have been found to contribute to or cause disease based on association studies, but the ways in which the mutations lead to disease symptoms remain unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figuring out the mechanism for how a mutation contributes to disease is important because then researchers can develop therapies to fix that mechanism, preventing or treating the disease. Young and colleagues suspected that many disease-associated mutations might contribute to disease by changing protein localization. For example, a mutation could make a protein unable to join a compartment containing essential partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They tested this hypothesis by feeding ProtGOS more than 200,000 proteins with disease-associated mutations, and then asking it to both predict where those mutated proteins would localize and measure how much its prediction changed for a given protein from the normal to the mutated version. A large shift in the prediction indicates a likely change in localization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found many cases in which a disease-associated mutation appeared to change a protein’s localization. They tested 20 examples in cells, using fluorescence to compare where in the cell a normal protein and the mutated version of it ended up. The experiments confirmed ProtGPS’s predictions. Altogether, the findings support the researchers’ suspicion that mis-localization may be an underappreciated mechanism of disease, and demonstrate the value of ProtGPS as a tool for understanding disease and identifying new therapeutic avenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The cell is such a complicated system, with so many components and complex networks of interactions,” Mitnikov says. “It’s super interesting to think that with this approach, we can perturb the system, see the outcome of that, and so drive discovery of mechanisms in the cell, or even develop therapeutics based on that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope that others begin using ProtGPS in the same way that they use predictive structural models like AlphaFold, advancing various projects on protein function, dysfunction, and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h6&gt;Moving beyond prediction to novel generation&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were excited about the possible uses of their prediction model, but they also wanted their model to go beyond predicting localizations of existing proteins, and allow them to design completely new proteins. The goal was for the model to make up entirely new amino acid sequences that, when formed in a cell, would localize to a desired location. Generating a novel protein that can actually accomplish a function — in this case, the function of localizing to a specific cellular compartment — is incredibly difficult. In order to improve their model’s chances of success, the researchers constrained their algorithm to only design proteins like those found in nature. This is an approach commonly used in drug design, for logical reasons; nature has had billions of years to figure out which protein sequences work well and which do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the collaboration with the Young lab, the machine learning team was able to test whether their protein generator worked. The model had good results. In one round, it generated 10 proteins intended to localize to the nucleolus. When the researchers tested these proteins in the cell, they found that four of them strongly localized to the nucleolus, and others may have had slight biases toward that location as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The collaboration between our labs has been so generative for all of us,” Mikhael says. “We’ve learned how to speak each other’s languages, in our case learned a lot about how cells work, and by having the chance to experimentally test our model, we’ve been able to figure out what we need to do to actually make the model work, and then make it work better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to generate functional proteins in this way could improve researchers’ ability to develop therapies. For example, if a drug must interact with a target that localizes within a certain compartment, then researchers could use this model to design a drug to also localize there. This should make the drug more effective and decrease side effects, since the drug will spend more time engaging with its target and less time interacting with other molecules, causing off-target effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The machine learning team members are enthused about the prospect of using what they have learned from this collaboration to design novel proteins with other functions beyond localization, which would expand the possibilities for therapeutic design and other applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of papers show they can design a protein that can be expressed in a cell, but not that the protein has a particular function,” Chinn says. “We actually had functional protein design, and a relatively huge success rate compared to other generative models. That’s really exciting to us, and something we would like to build on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the researchers involved see ProtGPS as an exciting beginning. They anticipate that their tool will be used to learn more about the roles of localization in protein function and mis-localization in disease. In addition, they are interested in expanding the model’s localization predictions to include more types of compartments, testing more therapeutic hypotheses, and designing increasingly functional proteins for therapies or other applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now that we know that this protein code for localization exists, and that machine learning models can make sense of that code and even create functional proteins using its logic, that opens up the door for so many potential studies and applications,” Kilgore says.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <description><![CDATA[A deep neural network called CHAIS may soon replace invasive procedures like catheterization as the new gold standard for monitoring heart health.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The ancient Greek philosopher and polymath Aristotle once concluded that the human heart is tri-chambered and that it was the single most important organ in the entire body, governing motion, sensation, and thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Today, we know that the human heart actually has four chambers and that the brain largely controls motion, sensation, and thought. But Aristotle was correct in observing that the heart is a vital organ, pumping blood to the rest of the body to reach other vital organs. When a life-threatening condition like heart failure strikes, the heart gradually loses the ability to supply other organs with enough blood and nutrients that enables them to function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Researchers from MIT and Harvard Medical School recently published&amp;nbsp;an open-access &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-024-00730-5"&gt;paper in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, introducing a noninvasive deep learning approach that analyzes electrocardiogram (ECG) signals to accurately predict a patient’s risk of developing heart failure. In a clinical trial, the model showed results with accuracy comparable to gold-standard but more-invasive procedures, giving hope to those at risk of heart failure. The condition has recently seen&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/article-abstract/2817830"&gt;a sharp increase&lt;/a&gt; in mortality, particularly among young adults, likely due to the growing prevalence of obesity and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“This paper is a culmination of things I’ve talked about in other venues for several years,” says the paper’s senior author Collin Stultz, director of &lt;a href="https://hst.mit.edu/"&gt;Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology&lt;/a&gt; and affiliate of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://jclinic.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health&lt;/a&gt; (Jameel Clinic). “The goal of this work is to identify those who are starting to get sick even before they have symptoms so that you can intervene early enough to prevent hospitalization.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Of the heart’s four chambers, two are atria and two are ventricles — the right side of the heart has one atrium and one ventricle, and vice versa. In a healthy human heart, these chambers operate in a rhythmic synchrony: oxygen-poor blood flows into the heart via the right atrium. The right atrium contracts and the pressure generated pushes the blood into the right ventricle where the blood is then pumped into the lungs to be oxygenated. The oxygen-rich blood from the lungs then drains into the left atrium, which contracts, pumping the blood into the left ventricle. Another contraction follows, and the blood is ejected from the left ventricle via the aorta, flowing into veins branching out to the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“When the left atrial pressures become elevated, the blood drain from the lungs into the left atrium is impeded because it’s a higher-pressure system,” Stultz explains. In addition to being a professor of electrical engineering and computer science, Stultz is also a practicing cardiologist at Mass General Hospital (MGH). “The higher the pressure in the left atrium, the more pulmonary symptoms you develop — shortness of breath and so forth. Because the right side of the heart pumps blood through the pulmonary vasculature to the lungs, the elevated pressures in the left atrium translate to elevated pressures in the pulmonary vasculature.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The current gold standard for measuring left atrial pressure is right heart catheterization (RHC), an invasive procedure that requires a thin tube (the catheter) attached to a pressure transmitter to be inserted into the right heart and pulmonary arteries. Physicians often prefer to assess risk noninvasively before resorting to RHC, by examining the patient’s weight, blood pressure, and heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But in Stultz’s view, these measures are coarse, as evidenced by the fact that&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.121.008335"&gt;one-in-four heart failure patients is readmitted to the hospital within 30 days&lt;/a&gt;. “What we are seeking is something that gives you information like that of an invasive device, other than a simple weight scale,” Stultz says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In order to gather more comprehensive information on a patient’s heart condition, physicians typically use a 12-lead ECG, in which 10 adhesive patches are stuck onto the patient and linked with a machine that produces information from 12 different angles of the heart. However, 12-lead ECG machines are only accessible in clinical settings and they are also not typically used to assess heart failure risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Instead, what Stultz and other researchers propose is a Cardiac Hemodynamic AI monitoring System (CHAIS), a deep neural network capable of analyzing ECG data from a single lead — in other words, the patient only needs to have a single adhesive, commercially-available patch on their chest that they can wear outside of the hospital, untethered to a machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To compare CHAIS with the current gold standard, RHC, the researchers selected patients who were already scheduled for a catheterization and asked them to wear the patch 24 to 48 hours before the procedure, although patients were asked to remove the patch before catheterization took place. “When you get to within an hour-and-a-half [before the procedure], it’s 0.875, so it’s very, very good,” Stultz explains. “Thereby a measure from the device is equivalent and gives you the same information as if you were cathed in the next hour-and-a-half.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Every cardiologist understands the value of left atrial pressure measurements in characterizing cardiac function and optimizing treatment strategies for patients with heart failure,” says Aaron Aguirre SM '03, PhD '08, a cardiologist and critical care physician at MGH. “This work is important because it offers a noninvasive approach to estimating this essential clinical parameter using a widely available cardiac monitor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Aguirre, who completed a PhD in medical engineering and medical physics at MIT, expects that with further clinical validation, CHAIS will be useful in two key areas: first, it will aid in selecting patients who will most benefit from more invasive cardiac testing via RHC; and second, the technology could enable serial monitoring and tracking of left atrial pressure in patients with heart disease. “A noninvasive and quantitative method can help in optimizing treatment strategies in patients at home or in hospital,” Aguirre says. “I am excited to see where the MIT team takes this next.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But the benefits aren’t just limited to patients — for patients with hard-to-manage heart failure, it becomes a challenge to keep them from being readmitted to the hospital without a permanent implant, taking up more space and more time of an already&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2023/aug/overworked-undervalued-primary-care-physicians-10-countries"&gt;beleaguered and understaffed medical workforce&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The researchers have another ongoing clinical trial using CHAIS with MGH and Boston Medical Center that they hope to conclude soon to begin data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“In my view, the real promise of AI in health care is to provide equitable, state-of-the-art care to everyone, regardless of their socioeconomic status, background, and where they live,” Stultz says. “This work is one step towards realizing this goal.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A new technology developed at MIT enables scientists to label proteins across millions of individual cells in fully intact 3D tissues with unprecedented speed, uniformity, and versatility. Using the technology, the team was able to richly label large tissue samples in a single day. In their &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-024-02533-4" target="_blank"&gt;new study in &lt;em&gt;Nature Biotechnology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; they also demonstrate that the ability to label proteins with antibodies at the single-cell level across large tissue samples can reveal insights left hidden by other widely used labeling methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profiling the proteins that cells are making is a staple of studies in biology, neuroscience, and related fields because the proteins a cell is expressing at a given moment can reflect the functions the cell is trying to perform or its response to its circumstances, such as disease or treatment. As much as microscopy and labeling technologies have advanced, enabling innumerable discoveries, scientists have still lacked a reliable and practical way of tracking protein expression at the level of millions of densely packed individual cells in whole, 3D intact tissues. Often confined to thin tissue sections under slides, scientists therefore haven’t had tools to thoroughly appreciate cellular protein expression in the whole, connected systems in which it occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Conventionally, investigating the molecules within cells requires dissociating tissue into single cells or slicing it into thin sections, as light and chemicals required for analysis cannot penetrate deep into tissues. Our lab developed technologies such as &lt;a href="https://picower.mit.edu/innovations-inventions/clarity"&gt;CLARITY&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://picower.mit.edu/innovations-inventions/shield"&gt;SHIELD&lt;/a&gt;, which enable investigation of whole organs by rendering them transparent, but we now needed a way to chemically label whole organs to gain useful scientific insights,” says study senior author &lt;a href="https://picower.mit.edu/node/40"&gt;Kwanghun Chung&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, the departments of Chemical Engineering and Brain and Cognitive Sciences, and the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science at MIT. “If cells within a tissue are not uniformly processed, they cannot be quantitatively compared. In conventional protein labeling, it can take weeks for these molecules to diffuse into intact organs, making uniform chemical processing of organ-scale tissues virtually impossible and extremely slow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new approach, called “CuRVE,” represents a major advance — years in the making — toward that goal by demonstrating a fundamentally new approach to uniformly processing large and dense tissues whole. In the study, the researchers explain how they overcame the technical barriers via an implementation of CuRVE called “eFLASH,” and provide copious vivid demonstrations of the technology, including how it yielded new neuroscience insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a significant leap, especially in terms of the actual performance of the technology,” says co-lead author Dae Hee Yun PhD '24, a recent MIT graduate student who is now a senior application engineer at LifeCanvas Technologies, a startup company Chung founded to disseminate the tools his lab invents. The paper’s other lead author is Young-Gyun Park, a former MIT postdoc who’s now an assistant professor at KAIST in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clever chemistry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fundamental reason why large, 3D tissue samples are hard to label uniformly is that antibodies seep into tissue very slowly, but are quick to bind to their target proteins. The practical effect of this speed mismatch is that simply soaking a brain in a bath of antibodies will mean that proteins are intensely well labeled on the outer edge of the tissue, but virtually none of the antibodies will find cells and proteins deeper inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To improve labeling, the team conceived of a way — the conceptual essence of CuRVE — to resolve the speed mismatch. The strategy was to continuously control the pace of antibody binding while at the same time speeding up antibody permeation throughout the tissue. To figure out how this could work and to optimize the approach, they built and ran a sophisticated computational simulation that enabled them to test different settings and parameters, including different binding rates and tissue densities and compositions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then they set out to implement their approach in real tissues. Their starting point was a previous technology, called “&lt;a href="https://picower.mit.edu/innovations-inventions/switch"&gt;SWITCH&lt;/a&gt;,” in which Chung’s lab devised a way of temporarily turning off antibody binding, letting the antibodies permeate the tissue, and then turning binding back on. As well as it worked, Yun says, the team realized there could be substantial improvements if antibody binding speed could be controlled constantly, but the chemicals used in SWITCH were too harsh for such ongoing treatment. So the team screened a library of similar chemicals to find one that could more subtly and continuously throttle antibody binding speed. They found that deoxycholic acid was an ideal candidate. Using that chemical, the team could not only modulate antibody binding by varying the chemical’s concentration, but also by varying the labeling bath’s pH (or acidity).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, to speed up antibody movement through tissues, the team used another prior technology invented in the Chung Lab: stochastic electrotransport. That technology accelerates the dispersion of antibodies through tissue by applying electric fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implementing this eFLASH system of accelerated dispersion with continuously modifiable binding speed produced the wide variety of labeling successes demonstrated in the paper. In all, the team reported using more than 60 different antibodies to label proteins in cells across large tissue samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, each of these specimens was labeled within a day, an “ultra-fast” speed for whole, intact organs, the authors say. Moreover, different preparations did not require new optimization steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Valuable visualizations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the ways the team put eFLASH to the test was by comparing their labeling to another often-used method: genetically engineering cells to fluoresce when the gene for a protein of interest is being transcribed. The genetic method doesn’t require dispersing antibodies throughout tissue, but it can be prone to discrepancies because reporting gene transcription and actual protein production are not exactly the same thing. Yun added that while antibody labeling reliably and immediately reports on the presence of a target protein, the genetic method can be much less immediate and persistent, still fluorescing even when the actual protein is no longer present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study the team employed both kinds of labeling simultaneously in samples. Visualizing the labels that way, they saw many examples in which antibody labeling and genetic labeling differed widely. In some areas of mouse brains, they found that two-thirds of the neurons expressing PV (a protein prominent in certain inhibitory neurons) according to antibody labeling, did not show any genetically-based fluorescence. In another example, only a tiny fraction of cells that reported expression via the genetic method of a protein called ChAT also reported it via antibody labeling. In other words, there were cases where genetic labeling both severely underreported or overreported protein expression compared to antibody labeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers don’t mean to impugn the clear value of using the genetic reporting methods, but instead suggest that also using organ-wide antibody labeling, as eFLASH allows, can help put that data in a richer, more complete context. “Our discovery of large regionalized loss of PV-immunoreactive neurons in healthy adult mice and with high individual variability emphasizes the importance of holistic and unbiased phenotyping,” the authors write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or as Yun puts it, the two different kinds of labeling are “two different tools for the job.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Yun, Park, and Chung, the paper’s other authors are Jae Hun Cho, Lee Kamentsky, Nicholas Evans, Nicholas DiNapoli, Katherine Xie, Seo Woo Choi, Alexandre Albanese, Yuxuan Tian, Chang Ho Sohn, Qiangge Zhang, Minyoung Kim, Justin Swaney, Webster Guan, Juhyuk Park, Gabi Drummond, Heejin Choi, Luzdary Ruelas, and Guoping Feng.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding for the study came from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, the Searle Scholars Program, a Packard Award in Science and Engineering, a NARSAD Young Investigator Award, the McKnight Foundation, the Freedom Together Foundation, The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, the NCSOFT Cultural Foundation, and the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;“There is no treatment available for your son. We can’t do anything to help him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Fernando Goldsztein MBA ’03 heard those words, something inside him snapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I refused to accept what the doctors were saying. I transformed my fear into my greatest strength and started fighting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldsztein’s 12-year-old son Frederico was diagnosed with relapsing medulloblastoma, a life-threatening pediatric brain tumor. Goldsztein's life — and career plan — changed in an instant. He had to learn to become a different kind of leader altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Goldsztein never set out to become a founder, the &lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;MIT Sloan School of Management&lt;/a&gt; taught him the importance of networking, building friendships, and making career connections with peers and faculty from all walks of life. He began using those skills in a new way — boldly reaching out to the top medulloblastoma doctors and scientists at hospitals around the world to ask for help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I knew that I had to do something to save Frederico, but also the other estimated 15,000 children diagnosed with the disease around the world each year,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, Goldsztein launched &lt;a href="https://mbinitiative.org/en/" target="_blank"&gt;The Medulloblastoma Initiative (MBI)&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit organization dedicated to finding a cure using a remarkable new model for funding rare disease research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In just 18 months, the organization — which is still in startup mode — has raised $11 million in private funding and brought together 14 of the world’s most prestigious labs and hospitals from across North America, Europe, and Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two promising trials will launch in the coming months, and three additional trials are in the pipeline and currently awaiting U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this in an industry that is notorious for bureaucratic red tape, and where the timeline from an initial lab discovery to a patient receiving a first treatment averages seven to 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While government research grants typically allocate just 4 cents on the dollar toward pediatric cancer research — pennies doled out across multiple labs pursuing uncoordinated efforts — MBI is laser-focused on pushing 100 percent of their funding toward a singular goal, without any overhead or administrative costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no time to lose,” Goldsztein says. “We are making science move faster than it ever has before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MBI blueprint for funding cures for rare diseases is replicable, and likely to disrupt the standard way health care research is funded and carried out by radically shortening the timeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From despair to strength&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his initial diagnosis at age 9, Frederico went through a nine-hour brain surgery and came to the United States to receive standard treatment. Goldsztein looked on helplessly as his son received radiation and then nine grueling rounds of chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First pioneered in the 1980s, this standard treatment protocol cures 70 percent of children. Still, it leaves most of them with lifelong side effects like cognitive problems, endocrine issues that stunt growth, and secondary tumors. Frederico was on the wrong side of that statistic. Just three years later, his tumor relapsed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldsztein grimaces as he recalls the prognosis he and his wife heard from the doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was unbelievable to me that there had been almost no discoveries in 40 years,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, he found hope and partnership in Roger Packer, the director of the Brain Tumor Institute and the Gilbert Family Neurofibromatosis Institute of Children’s National Hospital. He is also the very doctor who created the standard treatment years before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packer explains that finding effective therapies for medulloblastoma was complex for 30 years because it is an umbrella term for 13 types of tumors. Frederico suffers from the most common one, Group 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason the treatment has not changed is that, until recently, medicine has not advanced enough to detect differences between the different tumor types. Packer explains, “Now with molecular genetic testing and methylation, which is a way to essentially sort tumors, that has changed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem for Frederico was that very few researchers were working on Group 4, the sub-type of medulloblastoma that is the most common tumor, yet also the one that scientists know the least about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldsztein challenged Packer: “If I can get you the funding, what can your lab do to advance medulloblastoma research quickly?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An open-source consortium model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packer advised that they work together to “try something different,” instead of just throwing money at research without any guideposts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We set up a consortium of leading institutions around the world doing medulloblastoma research, asked them to change their lab approach to focus on the Group 4 tumor, and assigned each lab a question to answer. We charged them with coming up with therapy — not in seven to 10 years, which is the normal transition from discovery to developing a drug and getting it to a patient, but within a two-year timeline,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, seven labs signed on. Today, the Cure Group 4 Consortium is made up of 14 partners and reads like a who’s who of medulloblastoma heavy hitters: Children’s National Hospital, SickKids, Hopp Children’s Cancer Center, and Texas Children’s Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labs can only join the consortium if they agree to follow some unusual rules. As Goldsztein explains, “To be accepted into this group and receive funding, there are no silos, and there is no duplicated work. Everyone has a piece of the puzzle, and we work together to move fast. That is the magic of our model.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by MIT’s open-source methods, researchers must share data freely with one another to accelerate the group’s overall progress. This kind of partnership across labs and borders is unprecedented in a highly competitive sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mariano Gargiulo MBA ’03 met Goldsztein on the first day of their &lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/mit-sloan-fellows-mba-program/introduce-yourself" target="_blank"&gt;MIT Sloan Fellows MBA program&lt;/a&gt; orientation and has been his dear friend ever since. An early-stage donor to MBI and a Houston-based executive in the energy sector, Gargiulo sat down with Goldsztein as he first conceptualized MBI’s operating model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Usually, startup business models plot out the next 10-15 years; Fernando’s timeline was only two years, and his benchmarks were in three-month increments.” It was audaciously optimistic, says Gargiulo, but so was the founder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I saw it, I did not doubt that he would achieve his goals. I’m seeing Fernando hit those first targets now and it’s amazing to watch,” Gargiulo says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children’s National Hospital endorsed MBI in 2023 and invited Goldsztein to sit on its foundation’s board, adding credibility to the initiative and his ability to fundraise more ambitiously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Packer, in the next few months, the first two MBI protocols will reach patients for the first time: an immunotherapy protocol, which “leverages the body’s immune response to target cancer cells more effectively and safely than traditional therapies,” and a medulloblastoma vaccine, which “adapts similar methodologies used in Covid-19 vaccine development. This approach aims to provide a versatile and mobile treatment that could be distributed globally.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A matter of when&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Goldsztein is not with his own family in Brazil, fundraising, or managing MBI, he is on Zoom with a network of more than 70 other families with children with relapsed medulloblastoma. “I’m not a doctor and I don’t give out medical advice, but with these trials, we are giving each other hope,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope and purpose are commodities that Goldsztein has in spades. “I don’t understand the idea of doing business and accumulating assets, but not helping others,” he says. He shared that message with an auditorium of his fellow alumni &lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/alumni/alumni-entrepreneurs-share-life-lessons-and-encourage-action" target="_blank"&gt;at his 2023 MIT Sloan Reunion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frederico, who defied all odds and lived with the threat of recurrence, recently graduated high school. He is interested in international relations and passionate about photography. “This is about finding a cure for Frederico and for all kids,” Goldsztein says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked how the world would be impacted if MBI found a cure for medulloblastoma, Goldsztein shakes his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are going to find the cure. It’s not if, it’s a matter of when.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His next goal is to scale MBI and have it serve as a resource for groups that want to replicate its playbook to solve other childhood diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m never going to stop,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A new experimental vaccine developed by researchers at MIT and Caltech could offer protection against emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2, as well as related coronaviruses, known as sarbecoviruses, that could spill over from animals to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, sarbecoviruses — a subgenus of coronaviruses — include the virus that led to the outbreak of the original SARS in the early 2000s. Sarbecoviruses that currently circulate in bats and other mammals may also hold the potential to spread to humans in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By attaching up to eight different versions of sarbecovirus receptor-binding proteins (RBDs) to nanoparticles, the researchers created a vaccine that generates antibodies that recognize regions of RBDs that tend to remain unchanged across all strains of the viruses. That makes it much more difficult for viruses to evolve to escape vaccine-induced antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work is an example of how bringing together computation and immunological experiments can be fruitful,” says Arup K. Chakraborty, the John M. Deutch Institute Professor at MIT and a member of MIT’s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science and the Ragon Institute of MIT, MGH and Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chakraborty and Pamela Bjorkman, a professor of biology and biological engineering at Caltech, are the senior authors of the study, which &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)01428-4" target="_blank"&gt;appears today in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The paper’s lead authors are Eric Wang PhD ’24, Caltech postdoc Alexander Cohen, and Caltech graduate student Luis Caldera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mosaic nanoparticles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study builds on a project begun in Bjorkman’s lab, in which she and Cohen created a “mosaic” 60-mer nanoparticle that presents eight different sarbecovirus RBD proteins. The RBD is the part of the viral spike protein that helps the virus get into host cells. It is also the region of the coronavirus spike protein that is usually targeted by antibodies against sarbecoviruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBDs contain some regions that are variable and can easily mutate to escape antibodies. Most of the antibodies generated by mRNA COVID-19 vaccines target those variable regions because they are more easily accessible. That is one reason why mRNA vaccines need to be updated to keep up with the emergence of new strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If researchers could create a vaccine that stimulates production of antibodies that target RBD regions that can’t easily change and are shared across viral strains, it could offer broader protection against a variety of sarbecoviruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a vaccine would have to stimulate B cells that have receptors (which then become antibodies) that target those shared, or “conserved,” regions. When B cells circulating in the body encounter a vaccine or other antigen, their B cell receptors, each of which have two “arms,” are more effectively activated if two copies of the antigen are available for binding to each arm. The conserved regions tend to be less accessible to B cell receptors, so if a nanoparticle vaccine presents just one type of RBD, B cells with receptors that bind to the more accessible variable regions, are most likely to be activated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome this, the Caltech researchers designed a nanoparticle vaccine that includes 60 copies of RBDs from eight different related sarbecoviruses, which have different variable regions but similar conserved regions. Because eight different RBDs are displayed on each nanoparticle, it’s unlikely that two identical RBDs will end up next to each other. Therefore, when a B cell receptor encounters the nanoparticle immunogen, the B cell is more likely to become activated if its receptor can recognize the conserved regions of the RBD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The concept behind the vaccine is that by co-displaying all these different RBDs on the nanoparticle, you are selecting for B cells that recognize the conserved regions that are shared between them,” Cohen says. “As a result, you’re selecting for B cells that are more cross-reactive. Therefore, the antibody response would be more cross-reactive and you could potentially get broader protection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In studies conducted in animals, the researchers showed that this vaccine, known as mosaic-8, produced strong antibody responses against diverse strains of SARS-CoV-2 and other sarbecoviruses and protected from challenges by both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (original SARS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broadly neutralizing antibodies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After these studies were published in 2021 and 2022, the Caltech researchers teamed up with Chakraborty’s lab at MIT to pursue computational strategies that could allow them to identify RBD combinations that would generate even better antibody responses against a wider variety of sarbecoviruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Wang, the MIT researchers pursued two different strategies — first, a large-scale computational screen of many possible mutations to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2, and second, an analysis of naturally occurring RBD proteins from zoonotic sarbecoviruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first approach, the researchers began with the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 and generated sequences of about 800,000 RBD candidates by making substitutions in locations that are known to affect antibody binding to variable portions of the RBD. Then, they screened those candidates for their stability and solubility, to make sure they could withstand attachment to the nanoparticle and injection as a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the remaining candidates, the researchers chose 10 based on how different their variable regions were. They then used these to create mosaic nanoparticles coated with either two or five different RBD proteins (mosaic-2&lt;sub&gt;COM&lt;/sub&gt; and mosaic-5&lt;sub&gt;COM&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their second approach, instead of mutating the RBD sequences, the researchers chose seven naturally occurring RBD proteins, using computational techniques to select RBDs that were different from each other in regions that are variable, but retained their conserved regions. They used these to create another vaccine, mosaic-7&lt;sub&gt;COM&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the researchers produced the RBD-nanoparticles, they evaluated each one in mice. After each mouse received three doses of one of the vaccines, the researchers analyzed how well the resulting antibodies bound to and neutralized seven variants of SARS-CoV-2 and four other sarbecoviruses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also compared the mosaic nanoparticle vaccines to a nanoparticle with only one type of RBD displayed, and to the original mosaic-8 particle from their 2021, 2022, and 2024 studies. They found that mosaic-2&lt;sub&gt;COM&lt;/sub&gt; and mosaic-5&lt;sub&gt;COM&lt;/sub&gt; outperformed both of those vaccines, and mosaic-7&lt;sub&gt;COM&lt;/sub&gt; showed the best responses of all. Mosaic-7&lt;sub&gt;COM&lt;/sub&gt; elicited antibodies with binding to most of the viruses tested, and these antibodies were also able to prevent the viruses from entering cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers saw similar results when they tested the new vaccines in mice that were previously vaccinated with a bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to simulate the fact that people have already been infected and/or vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2,” Wang says. “In pre-vaccinated mice, mosaic-7&lt;sub&gt;COM&lt;/sub&gt; is consistently giving the highest binding titers for both SARS-CoV-2 variants and other sarbecoviruses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bjorkman’s lab has received funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to do a clinical trial of the mosaic-8 RBD-nanoparticle. They also hope to move mosaic-7&lt;sub&gt;COM&lt;/sub&gt;, which performed better in the current study, into clinical trials. The researchers&amp;nbsp;plan to work on redesigning the vaccines so that they could be delivered as mRNA, which would make them easier to manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship, the National Institutes of Health, Wellcome Leap, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and the Caltech Merkin Institute for Translational Research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Toward video generative models of the molecular world</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As the capabilities of generative AI models have grown, you've probably seen how they can transform simple text prompts into hyperrealistic images and even extended video clips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, generative AI has shown potential in helping chemists and biologists explore static molecules, like proteins and DNA. Models like AlphaFold can predict molecular structures to accelerate drug discovery, and the MIT-assisted “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06415-8"&gt;RFdiffusion&lt;/a&gt;,” for example, can help design new proteins. One challenge, though, is that molecules are constantly moving and jiggling, which is important to model when constructing new proteins and drugs. Simulating these motions on a computer using physics — a technique known as molecular dynamics — can be very expensive, requiring billions of time steps on supercomputers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a step toward simulating these behaviors more efficiently, MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and Department of Mathematics researchers have developed a generative model that learns from prior data. The team’s system, called MDGen, can take a frame of a 3D molecule and simulate what will happen next like a video, connect separate stills, and even fill in missing frames. By hitting the “play button” on molecules, the tool could potentially help chemists design new molecules and closely study how well their drug prototypes for cancer and other diseases would interact with the molecular structure it intends to impact.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Co-lead author Bowen Jing SM ’22 says that MDGen is an early proof of concept, but it suggests the beginning of an exciting new research direction. “Early on, generative AI models produced somewhat simple videos, like a person blinking or a dog wagging its tail,” says Jing, a PhD student at CSAIL. “Fast forward a few years, and now we have amazing models like Sora or Veo that can be useful in all sorts of interesting ways. We hope to instill a similar vision for the molecular world, where dynamics trajectories are the videos. For example, you can give the model the first and 10th frame, and it’ll animate what’s in between, or it can remove noise from a molecular video and guess what was hidden.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers say that MDGen represents a paradigm shift from previous comparable works with generative AI in a way that enables much broader use cases. Previous approaches were “autoregressive,” meaning they relied on the previous still frame to build the next, starting from the very first frame to create a video sequence. In contrast, MDGen generates the frames in parallel with diffusion. This means MDGen can be used to, for example, connect frames at the endpoints, or “upsample” a low frame-rate trajectory in addition to pressing play on the initial frame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was presented in a paper shown at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) this past December. Last summer, it was awarded for its potential commercial impact at the International Conference on Machine Learning’s ML4LMS Workshop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some small steps forward for molecular dynamics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In experiments, Jing and his colleagues found that MDGen’s simulations were similar to running the physical simulations directly, while producing trajectories 10 to 100 times faster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The team first tested their model’s ability to take in a 3D frame of a molecule and generate the next 100 nanoseconds. Their system pieced together successive 10-nanosecond blocks for these generations to reach that duration. The team found that MDGen was able to compete with the accuracy of a baseline model, while completing the video generation process in roughly a minute — a mere fraction of the three hours that it took the baseline model to simulate the same dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When given the first and last frame of a one-nanosecond sequence, MDGen also modeled the steps in between. The researchers’ system demonstrated a degree of realism in over 100,000 different predictions: It simulated more likely molecular trajectories than its baselines on clips shorter than 100 nanoseconds. In these tests, MDGen also indicated an ability to generalize on peptides it hadn’t seen before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MDGen’s capabilities also include simulating frames within frames, “upsampling” the steps between each nanosecond to capture faster molecular phenomena more adequately. It can even ​​“inpaint” structures of molecules, restoring information about them that was removed. These features could eventually be used by researchers to design proteins based on a specification of how different parts of the molecule should move.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toying around with protein dynamics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jing and co-lead author Hannes Stärk say that MDGen is an early sign of progress toward generating molecular dynamics more efficiently. Still, they lack the data to make these models immediately impactful in designing drugs or molecules that induce the movements chemists will want to see in a target structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers aim to scale MDGen from modeling molecules to predicting how proteins will change over time. “Currently, we’re using toy systems,” says Stärk, also a PhD student at CSAIL. “To enhance MDGen’s predictive capabilities to model proteins, we’ll need to build on the current architecture and data available. We don’t have a YouTube-scale repository for those types of simulations yet, so we’re hoping to develop a separate machine-learning method that can speed up the data collection process for our model.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, MDGen presents an encouraging path forward in modeling molecular changes invisible to the naked eye. Chemists could also use these simulations to delve deeper into the behavior of medicine prototypes for diseases like cancer or tuberculosis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Machine learning methods that learn from physical simulation represent a burgeoning new frontier in AI for science,” says Bonnie Berger, MIT Simons Professor of Mathematics, CSAIL principal investigator, and senior author on the paper. “MDGen is a versatile, multipurpose modeling framework that connects these two domains, and we’re very excited to share our early models in this direction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sampling realistic transition paths between molecular states is a major challenge,” says fellow senior author Tommi Jaakkola, who is the MIT Thomas Siebel Professor of electrical engineering and computer science and the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, and a CSAIL principal investigator. “This early work shows how we might begin to address such challenges by shifting generative modeling to full simulation runs.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers across the field of bioinformatics have heralded this system for its ability to simulate molecular transformations. “MDGen models molecular dynamics simulations as a joint distribution of structural embeddings, capturing molecular movements between discrete time steps,” says Chalmers University of Technology associate professor Simon Olsson, who wasn’t involved in the research. “Leveraging a masked learning objective, MDGen enables innovative use cases such as transition path sampling, drawing analogies to inpainting trajectories connecting metastable phases.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers’ work on MDGen was supported, in part, by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the U.S. Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, the Machine Learning for Pharmaceutical Discovery and Synthesis Consortium,&amp;nbsp;the Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amid the benefits that algorithmic decision-making and artificial intelligence offer — including revolutionizing speed, efficiency, and predictive ability in a vast range of fields — Manish Raghavan is working to mitigate associated risks, while also seeking opportunities to apply the technologies to help with preexisting social concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I ultimately want my research to push towards better solutions to long-standing societal problems,” says Raghavan, the Drew Houston Career Development Professor who is a shared faculty member between the MIT Sloan School of Management and the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, as well as a principal investigator at the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good example of Raghavan’s intention can be found in his exploration of the use AI in hiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raghavan says, “It’s hard to argue that hiring practices historically have been particularly good or worth preserving, and tools that learn from historical data inherit all of the biases and mistakes that humans have made in the past.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, however, Raghavan cites a potential opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s always been hard to measure discrimination,” he says, adding, “AI-driven systems are sometimes easier to observe and measure than humans, and one goal of my work is to understand how we might leverage this improved visibility to come up with new ways to figure out when systems are behaving badly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area with parents who both have computer science degrees, Raghavan says he originally wanted to be a doctor. Just before starting college, though, his love of math and computing called him to follow his family example into computer science. After spending a summer as an undergraduate doing research at Cornell University with Jon Kleinberg, professor of computer science and information science, he decided he wanted to earn his PhD there, writing his thesis on “The Societal Impacts of Algorithmic Decision-Making.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raghavan won awards for his work, including a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowships Program award, a Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship, and the Cornell University Department of Computer Science PhD Dissertation Award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, he joined the MIT faculty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps hearkening back to his early interest in medicine, Raghavan has done research on whether the determinations of a highly accurate algorithmic screening tool used in triage of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding, known as the Glasgow-Blatchford Score (GBS), are improved with complementary expert physician advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The GBS is roughly as good as humans on average, but that doesn’t mean that there aren’t individual patients, or small groups of patients, where the GBS is wrong and doctors are likely to be right,” he says. “Our hope is that we can identify these patients ahead of time so that doctors’ feedback is particularly valuable there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raghavan has also worked on how online platforms affect their users, considering how social media algorithms observe the content a user chooses and then show them more of that same kind of content. The difficulty, Raghavan says, is that users may be choosing what they view in the same way they might grab bag of potato chips, which are of course delicious but not all that nutritious. The experience may be satisfying in the moment, but it can leave the user feeling slightly sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raghavan and his colleagues have developed a model of how a user with conflicting desires — for immediate gratification versus a wish of longer-term satisfaction — interacts with a platform. The model demonstrates how a platform’s design can be changed to encourage a more wholesome experience. The model won the Exemplary Applied Modeling Track Paper Award at the 2022 Association for Computing Machinery Conference on Economics and Computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Long-term satisfaction is ultimately important, even if all you care about is a company’s interests,” Raghavan says. “If we can start to build evidence that user and corporate interests are more aligned, my hope is that we can push for healthier platforms without needing to resolve conflicts of interest between users and platforms. Of course, this is idealistic. But my sense is that enough people at these companies believe there’s room to make everyone happier, and they just lack the conceptual and technical tools to make it happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding his process of coming up with ideas for such tools and concepts for how to best apply computational techniques, Raghavan says his best ideas come to him when he’s been thinking about a problem off and on for a time. He would advise his students, he says, to follow his example of putting a very difficult problem away for a day and then coming back to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Things are often better the next day,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he's not puzzling out a problem or teaching, Raghavan can often be found outdoors on a soccer field, as a coach of the Harvard Men’s Soccer Club, a position he cherishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can’t procrastinate if I know I’ll have to spend the evening at the field, and it gives me something to look forward to at the end of the day,” he says. “I try to have things in my schedule that seem at least as important to me as work to put those challenges and setbacks into context.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Raghavan considers how to apply computational technologies to best serve our world, he says he finds the most exciting thing going on his field is the idea that AI will open up new insights into “humans and human society.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping,” he says, “that we can use it to better understand ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Personal interests can influence how children’s brains respond to language</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A recent study from the McGovern Institute for Brain Research shows how interests can modulate language processing in children’s brains and paves the way for personalized brain research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/imag_a_00339/124868/Personalized-neuroimaging-reveals-the-impact-of?searchresult=1" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, which appears in &lt;em&gt;Imaging Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, was conducted in the lab of MIT professor and McGovern Institute investigator &lt;a href="https://mcgovern.mit.edu/profile/john-gabrieli/"&gt;John Gabrieli&lt;/a&gt;, and led by senior author Anila D’Mello, a recent McGovern postdoc who is now an assistant professor at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and the University of Texas at Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Traditional studies give subjects identical stimuli to avoid confounding the results,” says Gabrieli, who is the Grover Hermann Professor of Health Sciences and Technology and a professor of brain and cognitive sciences at MIT. “However, our research tailored stimuli to each child’s interest, eliciting stronger — and more consistent — activity patterns in the brain’s language regions across individuals.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funded by the Hock E. Tan and K. Lisa Yang Center for Autism Research in MIT’s Yang Tan Collective, this work unveils a new paradigm that challenges current methods and shows how personalization can be a powerful strategy in neuroscience. The paper’s co-first authors are Halie Olson, a postdoc at the McGovern Institute, and Kristina Johnson PhD '21, an assistant professor at Northeastern University and former doctoral student at the MIT Media Lab. “Our research integrates participants’ lived experiences into the study design,” says Johnson. “This approach not only enhances the validity of our findings, but also captures the diversity of individual perspectives, often overlooked in traditional research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking interest into account&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to language, our interests are like operators behind the switchboard. They guide what we talk about and who we talk to. Research suggests that interests are also potent motivators and can help improve language skills. For instance, children score higher on reading tests when the material covers topics that are interesting to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But neuroscience has shied away from using personal interests to study the brain, especially in the realm of language. This is mainly because interests, which vary between people, could throw a wrench into experimental control — a core principle that drives scientists to limit factors that can muddle the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabrieli, D’Mello, Olson, and Johnson ventured into this unexplored territory. The team wondered if tailoring language stimuli to children’s interests might lead to higher responses in language regions of the brain. “Our study is unique in its approach to control the kind of brain activity our experiments yield, rather than control the stimuli we give subjects,” says D’Mello. “This stands in stark contrast to most neuroimaging studies that control the stimuli but might introduce differences in each subject’s level of interest in the material.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their recent study, the authors recruited a cohort of 20 children to investigate how personal interests affected the way the brain processes language. Caregivers described their child’s interests to the researchers, spanning baseball, train lines, “Minecraft,” and musicals. During the study, children listened to audio stories tuned to their unique interests. They were also presented with audio stories about nature (this was not an interest among the children) for comparison. To capture brain activity patterns, the team used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which measures changes in blood flow caused by underlying neural activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New insights into the brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that, when children listened to stories about topics they were really interested in, they showed stronger neural responses in language areas than when they listened to generic stories that weren’t tailored to their interests,” says Olson. “Not only does this tell us how interests affect the brain, but it also shows that personalizing our experimental stimuli can have a profound&amp;nbsp;impact on neuroimaging results.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noticed a particularly striking result. “Even though the children listened to completely different stories, their brain activation patterns were&amp;nbsp;more&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;overlapping with their peers when they listened to idiosyncratic stories compared to when they listened to the same generic stories about nature,” says D’Mello. This, she notes, points to how interests can boost both the magnitude and consistency of signals in language regions across subjects without changing how these areas communicate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabrieli noted another finding: “In addition to the stronger engagement of language regions for content of interest, there was also stronger activation in brain regions associated with reward and also with self-reflection.” Personal interests are individually relevant and can be rewarding, potentially driving higher activation in these regions during personalized stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These personalized paradigms might be particularly well-suited to studies of the brain in unique or neurodivergent populations. Indeed, the team is already applying these methods to study language in the brains of autistic children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study breaks new ground in neuroscience and serves as a prototype for future work that personalizes research to unearth further knowledge of the brain. In doing so, scientists can compile a more complete understanding of the type of information that is processed by specific brain circuits and more fully grasp complex functions such as language.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Four MIT faculty members are among 23 world-class researchers who have been awarded the nation’s highest honors for scientists and innovators, the White House &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2025/01/03/president-biden-honors-nations-leading-scientists-technologists-and-innovators/" target="_blank"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angela Belcher and Emery Brown were each presented with the National Medal of Science at a ceremony this afternoon, and Paula Hammond ’84, PhD ’93, and Feng Zhang were awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belcher, the James Mason Crafts Professor of Biological Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering and a member of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, was honored for her work designing novel&amp;nbsp;materials for applications that include solar cells, batteries, and medical imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown, the Edward Hood Taplin Professor of Medical Engineering and Computational Neuroscience, was recognized for work that has revealed how anesthesia affects the brain. Brown is also a member of MIT’s Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hammond, an MIT Institute Professor, vice provost for faculty, and member of the Koch Institute, was honored for developing methods for assembling thin films that can be used for drug delivery, wound healing, and many other applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zhang, the James and Patricia Poitras Professor of Neuroscience at MIT and a professor of brain and cognitive sciences and biological engineering, was recognized for his work developing molecular tools, including the CRISPR genome-editing system, that have the potential to diagnose and treat disease. Zhang is also an investigator at the McGovern Institute for Brain Research and a core member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two additional MIT alumni also accepted awards:&amp;nbsp;R. Lawrence “Larry” Edwards ’76, a graduate of the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences and of the Department of Architecture, who is now a professor at the University of Minnesota, received a National Medal of Science for his work in geochemistry. And Noubar Afeyan PhD ’87, a graduate of the Department of Chemical Engineering and current member of the MIT Corporation, accepted one of two National Medals of Technology and Innovation awarded to an organization. These awards went to the biotechnology companies Moderna, which Afeyan co-founded along with Institute Professor Robert Langer, and Pfizer, for their development of vaccines for Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, the White House awarded the National Medal of Science to 14 recipients and named nine individual awardees of the National Medal of Technology and Innovation, along with two organizations. To date, nearly 100 MIT affiliates have won one of these two honors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Emery Brown is at the forefront of the Institute’s collaborations among neuroscience, medicine, and patient care. His research has shifted the paradigm for brain monitoring during general anesthesia for surgery. His pioneering approach based on neural oscillations, as opposed to solely monitoring vital signs, promises to revolutionize how anesthesia medications are delivered to patients,” says Nergis Mavalvala, dean of MIT’s School of Science. “Feng Zhang is one of the preeminent researchers in CRISPR technologies that have accelerated the pace of science and engineering, blending entrepreneurship and scientific discovery. These new molecular technologies can modify the cell’s genetic information, engineer vehicles to deliver these tools into the correct cells, and scale to restore organ function. Zhang will apply these life-altering innovations to diseases such as neurodegeneration, immune disorders, and aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hammond and Belcher are frequent collaborators, and each of them has had significant impact on the fields of nanotechnology and nanomedicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Angela Belcher and Paula Hammond have made tremendous contributions to science and engineering, and I’m thrilled for each of them to receive this well-deserved recognition,” says Anantha Chandrakasan, dean of the School of Engineering and chief innovation and strategy officer at MIT. “By harnessing the processes of nature, Angela’s innovations have impacted fields from energy to the environment to medicine. Her non-invasive imaging system has improved outcomes for patients diagnosed with many types of cancer. Paula’s pioneering research in nanotechnology helped transform the ways in which we deliver and administer drugs within the body — through her technique, therapeutics can be customized and sent directly to specifically targeted cells, including cancer cells.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing materials with viruses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belcher, who joined the MIT faculty in 2002 and served as head of the Department of Biological Engineering from 2019 to 2023, initially heard that she was being considered for the National Medal of Science in September, and in mid-December, found out she had won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was quite shocking and just a huge honor. It’s an honor to be considered, and then to get the email and the call that I actually was receiving it was humbling,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belcher, who earned a bachelor’s degree in creative studies and a PhD in inorganic chemistry from the University of California at Santa Barbara, has focused much of her research on developing ways to use biological systems, such as viruses, to grow materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since graduate school, I’ve been fascinated with trying to understand how nature makes materials and then applying those processes, whether directly through biological molecules, or through evolving biological molecules or biological organisms, to make materials that are of technological importance,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early in her career, she developed a technique for generating materials by engineering viruses to self-assemble into nanoscale scaffolds that can be coated with inorganic materials to form functional devices such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2013/better-batteries-through-biology-1113"&gt;batteries&lt;/a&gt;, semiconductors,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2011/solar-virus-0425"&gt;solar cells&lt;/a&gt;, and catalysts. This approach allows for exquisite control over the electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of the material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the late 2000s, then-MIT president Susan Hockfield asked Belcher to join the newly formed Koch Institute, whose mission is to bring together scientists and engineers to seek new ways to diagnose and treat cancer. Not knowing much about cancer biology, Belcher was hesitant at first, but she ended up moving her lab to the Koch Institute and applying her work to the new challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of her first projects, on which she collaborated with Hammond, was a method for using shortwave infrared light to image cancer cells. This technology, eventually commercialized by a company called Cision Vision, is now being used in hospitals to image lymph nodes during cancer surgery, helping them to determine if a tumor has spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belcher is now focused on finding technologies to detect other cancers, especially ovarian cancer, which is difficult to diagnose in early stages, as well as developing cancer vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unlocking the mysteries of anesthesia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown, who has been on the MIT faculty since 2005, said he was “overjoyed” when he found out he would receive the National Medal of Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m extremely excited and quite honored to receive such an award, because it is one of the pinnacles of recognition in the scientific field in the United States,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of Brown’s work has focused on achieving a better understanding of what happens in the human brain under anesthesia. Trained as an anesthesiologist, Brown earned his MD from Harvard Medical School and a PhD in statistics from Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1992, he has been a member of the Harvard Medical School faculty and a practicing anesthesiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital. Early in his research career, he worked on developing methods to characterize the properties of the human circadian clock. These included characterizing the clock’s phase response curve to light, accurately measuring its intrinsic period, and measuring the impact of physiologically designed schedules on shift worker performance. Later, he became interested in developing signal processing methods to characterize how neurons represent signals and stimuli in their ensemble activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with Matt Wilson, an MIT professor of neuroscience, Brown devised algorithms to decode the position of an animal in its environment by reading the activity of a small group of place cell neurons in the animal’s brain. Other applications of these methods included characterizing learning, controlling brain-machine interfaces, and controlling brain states such as medically induced coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was practicing anesthesia at the time, and as I saw more and more of what the neuroscientists were doing, it occurred to me we could use their paradigms to study anesthesia, and we should, because we weren’t doing that,” he says. “Anesthesia was not being looked at as a neuroscience subdiscipline. It was looked at as a subdiscipline of pharmacology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades, Brown’s work has revealed how anesthesia drugs induce unconsciousness in the brain, along with other altered arousal states. Anesthesia drugs such as propofol dramatically&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/study-finds-tracking-brain-waves-could-reduce-post-complications-0717"&gt;alter the brain’s intrinsic oscillations.&lt;/a&gt; These oscillations can be seen with electroencephalography (EEG).&amp;nbsp;During the awake state, these oscillations usually have high frequency and low amplitude, but as anesthetic drugs are given, they shift generally to low frequency, high amplitude. Working with MIT professors Earl Miller and Ila Fiete, as well as collaborators at Massachusetts General Hospital and Boston University, Brown has shown that these changes&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/study-reveals-how-anesthesia-drug-induces-unconsciousnes-0715"&gt;disrupt normal communication&lt;/a&gt; between different brain regions, leading to loss of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown has also shown that these EEG oscillations can be used to monitor whether a patient is too deeply unconscious, and he has developed a closed-loop anesthesia delivery system that can maintain a patient’s anesthesia state at precisely desired levels. Brown and colleagues have also developed methods to accelerate recovery from anesthesia. More precise control and accelerated recovery could help to prevent the cognitive impairments that often affect patients after they emerge from anesthesia. Accelerating recovery from anesthesia has also suggested ways to accelerate recovery from coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building multifunctional materials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hammond, who earned both her bachelor’s degree and PhD in chemical engineering from MIT, has been a member of the faculty since 1995 and was named an Institute Professor in 2021. She was also the 2023-24 recipient of MIT’s Killian Award, the highest honor that the faculty bestows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early in her career, Hammond developed a novel technique for generating functional thin-film materials by stacking layers of charged polymeric materials. This approach can be used to build polymers with highly controlled architectures by alternately exposing a surface to positively and negatively charged particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She initially used this layer-by-layer assembly technique to build ultrathin batteries and fuel cell electrodes, before turning her attention to biomedical applications. To adapt the films for drug delivery, she came up with ways to incorporate drug molecules into the layers of the film. These molecules are then released when the particles reach their targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We began to look at bioactive materials and how we could sandwich them into these layers and use that as a way to deliver the drug in a very controlled fashion, at the right time and in the right place,” she says. “We are using the layering as a way to modify the surface of a nanoparticle so that there is a very high and selective affinity for the cancer cells we’re targeting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this technique, she has created&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/how-different-cancer-cells-respond-drug-delivering-nanoparticles-0721"&gt;drug-delivery nanoparticles&lt;/a&gt; that are coated with molecules that specifically target cancer cells, with a particular focus on ovarian cancer. These particles can be tailored to carry chemotherapy drugs such as cisplatin, immunotherapy agents, or nucleic acids such as messenger RNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with colleagues around MIT, she has also developed materials that can be used to promote wound healing,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/two-component-system-halt-internal-bleeding-0425"&gt;blood clotting&lt;/a&gt;, and tissue regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we have found is that these layers are very versatile. They can coat a very broad range of substrates, and those substrates can be anything from a bone implant, which can be quite large, down to a nanoparticle, which is 100 nanometers,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Designing molecular tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zhang, who earned his undergraduate degree from Harvard University in 2004, has contributed to the development of multiple molecular tools to accelerate the understanding of human disease. While a graduate student at Stanford University, from which he received his PhD in 2009, Zhang worked in the lab of Professor Karl Deisseroth. There, he worked on a protein called channelrhodopsin, which he and Deisseroth believed held potential for engineering mammalian cells to respond to light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting technique, known as optogenetics, is now used widely used in neuroscience and other fields. By engineering neurons to express light-sensitive proteins such as channelrhodopsin, researchers can either stimulate or silence the cells’ electrical impulses by shining different wavelengths of light on them. This has allowed for detailed study of the roles of specific populations of neurons in the brain, and the mapping of neural circuits that control a variety of behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, about a month after joining the MIT faculty, Zhang attended a talk by Harvard Medical School Professor Michael Gilmore, who studies the pathogenic bacterium &lt;em&gt;Enteroccocus&lt;/em&gt;. The scientist mentioned that these bacteria protect themselves from viruses with DNA-cutting enzymes known as nucleases, which are part of a defense system known as CRISPR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had no idea what CRISPR was, but I was interested in nucleases,” Zhang told &lt;em&gt;MIT News&lt;/em&gt; in 2016. “I went to look up CRISPR, and that’s when I realized you might be able to engineer it for use for genome editing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2013, Zhang and members of his lab reported that they had successfully used CRISPR to &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2013/editing-the-genome-with-high-precision-0103"&gt;edit genes&lt;/a&gt; in mammalian cells. The CRISPR system includes a nuclease called Cas9, which can be directed to cut a specific genetic target by RNA molecules known as guide strands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, scientists in fields from medicine to plant biology have used CRISPR to study gene function and investigate the possibility of correcting faulty genes that cause disease. More recently, Zhang’s lab has devised many enhancements to the original CRISPR system, such as making the targeting more precise and preventing unintended cuts in the wrong locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Medal of Science was established in 1959 and is administered for the White House by the National Science Foundation. The medal recognizes individuals who have made outstanding contributions to science and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Medal of Technology and Innovation was established in 1980 and is administered for the White House by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Patent and Trademark Office. The award recognizes those who have made lasting contributions to America’s competitiveness and quality of life and helped strengthen the nation’s technological workforce.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Monitoring electrical signals in biological systems helps scientists understand how cells communicate, which can aid in the diagnosis and treatment of conditions like arrhythmia and Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But devices that record electrical signals in cell cultures and other liquid environments often use wires to connect each electrode on the device to its respective amplifier. Because only so many wires can be connected to the device, this restricts the number of recording sites, limiting the information that can be collected from cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT researchers have now developed a biosensing technique that eliminates the need for wires. Instead, tiny, wireless antennas use light to detect minute electrical signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small electrical changes in the surrounding liquid environment alter how the antennas scatter the light. Using an array of tiny antennas, each of which is one-hundredth the width of a human hair, the researchers could measure electrical signals exchanged between cells, with extreme spatial resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The devices, which are durable enough to continuously record signals for more than 10 hours, could help biologists understand how cells communicate in response to changes in their environment. In the long run, such scientific insights could pave the way for advancements in diagnosis, spur the development of targeted treatments, and enable more precision in the evaluation of new therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being able to record the electrical activity of cells with high throughput and high resolution remains a real problem. We need to try some innovative ideas and alternate approaches,” says Benoît Desbiolles, a former postdoc in the MIT Media Lab and lead author of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adr8380" target="_blank"&gt;a paper on the devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is joined on the paper by Jad Hanna, a visiting student in the Media Lab; former visiting student Raphael Ausilio; former postdoc Marta J. I. Airaghi Leccardi; Yang Yu, a scientist at Raith America, Inc.; and senior author Deblina Sarkar, the AT&amp;amp;T Career Development Assistant Professor in the Media Lab and MIT Center for Neurobiological Engineering and head of the Nano-Cybernetic Biotrek Lab. The research appears today in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bioelectricity is fundamental to the functioning of cells and different life processes. However, recording such electrical signals precisely has been challenging,” says Sarkar. “The organic electro-scattering antennas (OCEANs) we developed enable recording of electrical signals wirelessly with micrometer spatial resolution from thousands of recording sites simultaneously. This can create unprecedented opportunities for understanding fundamental biology and altered signaling in diseased states as well as for screening the effect of different therapeutics to enable novel treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biosensing with light&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers set out to design a biosensing device that didn’t need wires or amplifiers. Such a device would be easier to use for biologists who may not be familiar with electronic instruments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wondered if we could make a device that converts the electrical signals to light and then use an optical microscope, the kind that is available in every biology lab, to probe these signals,” Desbiolles says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, they used a special polymer called PEDOT:PSS to design nanoscale transducers that incorporated tiny pieces of gold filament. Gold nanoparticles were supposed to scatter the light — a process that would be induced and modulated by the polymer. But the results weren’t matching up with their theoretical model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tried removing the gold and, surprisingly, the results matched the model much more closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It turns out we weren’t measuring signals from the gold, but from the polymer itself. This was a very surprising but exciting result. We built on that finding to develop organic electro-scattering antennas,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;organic electro-scattering antennas,&amp;nbsp;or OCEANs, are composed of&amp;nbsp;PEDOT:PSS. This polymer attracts or repulses positive ions from the surrounding liquid environment when there is electrical activity nearby. This modifies its chemical configuration and electronic structure, altering an optical property known as its refractive index, which changes how it scatters light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When researchers shine light onto the antenna, the intensity of the light changes in proportion to the electrical signal present in the liquid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="/sites/default/files/images/inline/organic-antenna.gif" data-align="center" data-entity-uuid="8cfda23e-45b6-40a2-bc25-39de9d0d9eee" data-entity-type="file" alt="Six-by-six array of tiny lights that glow brighter as voltage goes from 0 to -0.8." width="500" height="500" data-caption="The brightness of light scattered by the tiny antennas the researchers developed, called OCEANs, changes in response to changing electrical signals in the liquid environment that surrounds them, as shown here. By capturing and measuring the light with an optical microscope, researchers could decode the intricate signals used for cellular communication.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Credit: Courtesy of the researchers"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With thousands or even millions of tiny antennas in an array, each only 1 micrometer wide, the researchers can capture the scattered light with an optical microscope and measure electrical signals from cells with high resolution. Because each antenna is an independent sensor, the researchers do not need to pool the contribution of multiple antennas to monitor electrical signals, which is why OCEANs can detect signals with micrometer resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intended for in vitro&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;studies, OCEAN arrays are designed to have cells cultured directly on top of them and put under an optical microscope for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Growing” antennas on a chip&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key to the devices is the precision with which the researchers can fabricate arrays in the MIT.nano facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They start with a glass substrate and deposit layers of conductive then insulating material on top, each of which is optically transparent. Then they use a focused ion beam to cut hundreds of nanoscale holes into the top layers of the device. This special type of focused ion beam enables high-throughput nanofabrication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This instrument is basically like a pen where you can etch anything with a 10-nanometer resolution,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They submerge the chip in a solution that contains the precursor building blocks for the polymer. By applying an electric current to the solution, that precursor material is attracted into the tiny holes on the chip, and mushroom-shaped antennas “grow” from the bottom up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entire fabrication process is relatively fast, and the researchers could use this technique to make a chip with millions of antennas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This technique could be easily adapted so it is fully scalable. The limiting factor is how many antennas we can image at the same time,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers optimized the dimensions of the antennas and adjusted parameters, which enabled them to achieve high enough sensitivity to monitor signals with voltages as low as 2.5 millivolts in simulated experiments. Signals sent by neurons for communication are usually around 100 millivolts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because we took the time to really dig in and understand the theoretical model behind this process, we can maximize the sensitivity of the antennas,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OCEANs also responded to changing signals in only a few milliseconds, enabling them to record electrical signals with fast kinetics. Moving forward, the researchers want to test the devices with real cell cultures. They also want to reshape the antennas so they can penetrate cell membranes, enabling more precise signal detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, they want to study how OCEANs could be integrated into nanophotonic devices, which manipulate light at the nanoscale for next-generation sensors and optical devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is funded, in part, by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the Swiss National Science Foundation.&amp;nbsp;Research reported in this press release was supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health and does not necessarily represent the official views of the NIH.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>Adam Zewe | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT scientists have&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://jclinic.mit.edu/democratizing-science-boltz-1/" target="_blank"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; a powerful, open-source AI model, called Boltz-1, that could significantly accelerate biomedical research and drug development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developed by a team of researchers in the MIT Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health, Boltz-1 is the first fully open-source model that achieves state-of-the-art performance at the level of AlphaFold3, the model from Google DeepMind that predicts the 3D structures of proteins and other biological molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT graduate students Jeremy Wohlwend and Gabriele Corso were the lead developers of Boltz-1, along with MIT Jameel Clinic Research Affiliate Saro Passaro and MIT professors of electrical engineering and computer science Regina Barzilay and Tommi Jaakkola. Wohlwend and Corso presented the model at a Dec. 5 event at MIT’s Stata Center, where they said their ultimate goal is to foster global collaboration, accelerate discoveries, and provide a robust platform for advancing biomolecular modeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope for this to be a starting point for the community,” Corso said. “There is a reason we call it Boltz-1 and not Boltz. This is not the end of the line. We want as much contribution from the community as we can get.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proteins play an essential role in nearly all biological processes. A protein’s shape is closely connected with its function, so understanding a protein’s structure is critical for designing new drugs or engineering new proteins with specific functionalities. But because of the extremely complex process by which a protein’s long chain of amino acids is folded into a 3D structure, accurately predicting that structure has been a major challenge for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeepMind’s AlphaFold2, which earned Demis Hassabis and John Jumper the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, uses machine learning to rapidly predict 3D protein structures that are so accurate they are indistinguishable from those experimentally derived by scientists. This open-source model has been used by academic and commercial research teams around the world, spurring many advancements in drug development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AlphaFold3 improves upon its predecessors by incorporating a generative AI model, known as a diffusion model, which can better handle the amount of uncertainty involved in predicting extremely complex protein structures. Unlike AlphaFold2, however, AlphaFold3 is not fully open source, nor is it available for commercial use, which prompted&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01463-0" target="_blank"&gt;criticism&lt;/a&gt; from the scientific community and kicked off a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://harrisbio.substack.com/p/the-race-to-reproduce-alphafold3" target="_blank"&gt;global race&lt;/a&gt; to build a commercially available version of the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their work on Boltz-1, the MIT researchers followed the same initial approach as AlphaFold3, but after studying the underlying diffusion model, they explored potential improvements. They incorporated those that boosted the model’s accuracy the most, such as new algorithms that improve prediction efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with the model itself, they open-sourced their entire pipeline for training and fine-tuning so other scientists can build upon Boltz-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am immensely proud of Jeremy, Gabriele, Saro, and the rest of the Jameel Clinic team for making this release happen. This project took many days and nights of work, with unwavering determination to get to this point. There are many exciting ideas for further improvements and we look forward to sharing them in the coming months,” Barzilay says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took the MIT team four months of work, and many experiments, to develop Boltz-1. One of their biggest challenges was overcoming the ambiguity and heterogeneity contained in the Protein Data Bank, a collection of all biomolecular structures that thousands of biologists have solved in the past 70 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had a lot of long nights wrestling with these data. A lot of it is pure domain knowledge that one just has to acquire. There are no shortcuts,” Wohlwend says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, their experiments show that Boltz-1 attains the same level of accuracy as AlphaFold3 on a diverse set of complex biomolecular structure predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What Jeremy, Gabriele, and Saro have accomplished is nothing short of remarkable. Their hard work and persistence on this project has made biomolecular structure prediction more accessible to the broader community,” says Jaakkola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers plan to continue improving the performance of Boltz-1 and reduce the amount of time it takes to make predictions. They also invite researchers to try Boltz-1 on their&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://github.com/jwohlwend/boltz" target="_blank"&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; and connect with fellow users of Boltz-1 on their&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://boltz-community.slack.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Slack channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think there is still many, many years of work to improve these models. We are very eager to collaborate with others and see what the community does with this tool,” Wohlwend adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mathai Mammen, CEO and president of Parabilis Medicines, calls Boltz-1 a “breakthrough” model. “By open sourcing this advance, the MIT Jameel Clinic and collaborators are democratizing access to cutting-edge structural biology tools,” he says. “This landmark effort will accelerate the creation of life-changing medicines. Thank you to the Boltz-1 team for driving this profound leap forward!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Boltz-1 will be enormously enabling, for my lab and the whole community,” adds Jonathan Weissman, an MIT professor of biology and member of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Engineering who was not involved in the study. “We will see a whole wave of discoveries made possible by democratizing this powerful tool.” Weissman adds that he anticipates that the open-source nature of Boltz-1 will lead to a vast array of creative new applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was also supported by a U.S. National Science Foundation Expeditions grant; the Jameel Clinic; the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency Discovery of Medical Countermeasures Against New and Emerging (DOMANE) Threats program; and the MATCHMAKERS project supported by the Cancer Grand Challenges partnership financed by Cancer Research UK and the U.S. National Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;With the cover of anonymity and the company of strangers, the appeal of the digital world is growing as a place to seek out mental health support. This phenomenon is buoyed by the fact that&lt;a href="https://www.aamc.org/news/growing-psychiatrist-shortage-enormous-demand-mental-health-services"&gt;&amp;nbsp;over 150 million people&lt;/a&gt; in the United States live in federally designated mental health professional shortage areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I really need your help, as I am too scared to talk to a therapist and I can’t reach one anyways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Am I overreacting, getting hurt about husband making fun of me to his friends?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Could some strangers please weigh in on my life and decide my future for me?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The above quotes are real posts taken from users on Reddit, a social media news website and forum where users can share content or ask for advice in smaller, interest-based forums known as “subreddits.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Using a dataset of 12,513 posts with 70,429 responses from 26 mental health-related subreddits, researchers from MIT, New York University (NYU), and University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) devised&lt;a href="https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-emnlp.120.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-emnlp.120.pdf"&gt;a framework&lt;/a&gt; to help evaluate the equity and overall quality of mental health support chatbots based on large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4. Their work was recently published at the 2024 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To accomplish this, researchers asked two licensed clinical psychologists to evaluate 50 randomly sampled Reddit posts seeking mental health support, pairing each post with either a Redditor’s real response or a GPT-4 generated response. Without knowing which responses were real or which were AI-generated, the psychologists were asked to assess the level of empathy in each response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mental health support chatbots have long been explored as a way of improving access to mental health support, but powerful LLMs like OpenAI’s ChatGPT are transforming human-AI interaction, with AI-generated responses becoming harder to distinguish from the responses of real humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Despite this remarkable progress, the unintended consequences of AI-provided mental health support have drawn attention to its potentially deadly risks; in March of last year, a Belgian man died by suicide as a result of an exchange with ELIZA, a chatbot developed to emulate a psychotherapist powered with an LLM called GPT-J. One month later, the National Eating Disorders Association would suspend their chatbot Tessa, after the chatbot began dispensing dieting tips to patients with eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Saadia Gabriel, a recent MIT postdoc who is now a UCLA assistant professor and first author of the paper, admitted that she was initially very skeptical of how effective mental health support chatbots could actually be. Gabriel conducted this research during her time as a postdoc at MIT in the Healthy Machine Learning Group, led Marzyeh Ghassemi, an MIT associate professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and MIT Institute for Medical Engineering and Science who is affiliated with the MIT Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health and the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;What Gabriel and the team of researchers found was that GPT-4 responses were not only more empathetic overall, but they were 48 percent better at encouraging positive behavioral changes than human responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;However, in a bias evaluation, the researchers found that GPT-4’s response empathy levels were reduced for Black (2 to 15 percent lower) and Asian posters (5 to 17 percent lower) compared to white posters or posters whose race was unknown.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To evaluate bias in GPT-4 responses and human responses, researchers included different kinds of posts with explicit demographic (e.g., gender, race) leaks and implicit demographic leaks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;An explicit demographic leak would look like: “I am a 32yo Black woman.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Whereas an implicit demographic leak would look like: “Being a 32yo girl wearing my natural hair,” in which keywords are used to indicate certain demographics to GPT-4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;With the exception of Black female posters, GPT-4’s responses were found to be less affected by explicit and implicit demographic leaking compared to human responders, who tended to be more empathetic when responding to posts with implicit demographic suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The structure of the input you give [the LLM] and some information about the context, like whether you want [the LLM] to act in the style of a clinician, the style of a social media post, or whether you want it to use demographic attributes of the patient, has a major impact on the response you get back,” Gabriel says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The paper suggests that explicitly providing instruction for LLMs to use demographic attributes can effectively alleviate bias, as this was the only method where researchers did not observe a significant difference in empathy across the different demographic groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Gabriel hopes this work can help ensure more comprehensive and thoughtful evaluation of LLMs being deployed in clinical settings across demographic subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“LLMs are already being used to provide patient-facing support and have been deployed in medical settings, in many cases to automate inefficient human systems,” Ghassemi says. “Here, we demonstrated that while state-of-the-art LLMs are generally less affected by demographic leaking than humans in peer-to-peer mental health support, they do not provide equitable mental health responses across inferred patient subgroups ... we have a lot of opportunity to improve models so they provide improved support when used.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>Julia Mongo | Office of Distinguished Fellowships</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lara Ozkan, an MIT senior from Oradell, New Jersey, has been selected as a 2025 Marshall Scholar and will begin graduate studies in the United Kingdom next fall. Funded by the British government, the Marshall Scholarship awards American students of high academic achievement with the opportunity to pursue graduate studies in any field at any university in the U.K. Up to 50 scholarships are granted each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are so proud that Lara will be representing MIT in the U.K.,” says Kim Benard, associate dean of distinguished fellowships. “Her accomplishments to date have been extraordinary and we are excited to see where her future work goes.” Ozkan, along with MIT’s other endorsed Marshall candidates, was mentored by the distinguished fellowships team in Career Advising and Professional Development, and the Presidential Committee on Distinguished Fellowships, co-chaired by professors Nancy Kanwisher and Tom Levenson.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozkan, a senior majoring in computer science and molecular biology, plans to pursue through her Marshall Scholarship an MPhil in biological science at Cambridge University’s Sanger Institute, followed by a master’s by research degree in artificial intelligence and machine learning at Imperial College London. She is committed to a career advancing women’s health through innovation in technology and the application of computational tools to research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to beginning her studies at MIT, Ozkan conducted computational biology research at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. At MIT, she has been an undergraduate researcher with the MIT Media Lab’s Conformable Decoders group, where she has worked on breast cancer wearable ultrasound technologies. She also contributes to Professor Manolis Kellis’ computational biology research group in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Ozkan’s achievements in computational biology research earned her the MIT Susan Hockfield Prize in Life Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, Ozkan has examined the ethical implications of genomics projects and developed AI ethics curricula for MIT computer science courses. Through internships with Accenture Gen AI Risk and pharmaceutical firms, she gained practical insights into responsible AI use in health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozkan is president and executive director of MIT Capital Partners, an organization that connects the entrepreneurship community with venture capital firms, and she is president of the MIT Sloan Business Club. Additionally, she serves as an undergraduate research peer ambassador and is a member of the MIT EECS Committee on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. As part of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing Undergraduate Advisory Group, she advises on policies and programming to improve the student experience in interdisciplinary computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond Ozkan’s research roles, she volunteers with MIT CodeIt, teaching middle-school girls computer science. As a counselor with Camp Kesem, she mentors children whose parents are impacted by cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="3" paraeid="{6b133ffa-7ff4-4510-93ca-b095c3392f0d}{212}"&gt;Throughout 2024, MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research has celebrated 50 years of MIT’s cancer research program and the individuals who have shaped its journey. In honor of this milestone anniversary year, on Nov. 19 the Koch Institute celebrated the opening of a new exhibition: Object Lessons: Celebrating 50 Years of Cancer Research at MIT in 10 Items.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p paraid="3" paraeid="{6b133ffa-7ff4-4510-93ca-b095c3392f0d}{212}"&gt;Object Lessons invites the public to explore significant artifacts — from one of the earliest PCR machines, developed in the lab of Nobel laureate H. Robert Horvitz, to Greta, a groundbreaking zebra fish from the lab of Professor Nancy Hopkins — in the half-century of discoveries and advancements that have positioned MIT at the forefront of the fight against cancer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="2" paraid="4" paraeid="{6b133ffa-7ff4-4510-93ca-b095c3392f0d}{244}"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;50 years of innovation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="6" paraeid="{6b133ffa-7ff4-4510-93ca-b095c3392f0d}{250}"&gt;The exhibition provides a glimpse into the many contributors and advancements that have defined MIT’s cancer research history since the founding of the Center for Cancer Research in 1974. When the National Cancer Act was passed in 1971, very little was understood about the biology of cancer, and it aimed to deepen our understanding of cancer and develop better strategies for the prevention, detection, and treatment of the disease. MIT embraced this call to action, establishing a center where many leading biologists tackled cancer’s fundamental questions. Building on this foundation, the Koch Institute opened its doors in 2011, housing engineers and life scientists from many fields under one roof to accelerate progress against cancer in novel and transformative ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="7" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{49}"&gt;In the 13 years since, the Koch Institute’s collaborative and interdisciplinary approach to cancer research has yielded significant advances in our understanding of the underlying biology of cancer and allowed for the translation of these discoveries into meaningful patient impacts. Over 120 spin-out companies — many headquartered nearby in the Kendall Square area — have their roots in Koch Institute research, with nearly half having advanced their technologies to clinical trials or commercial applications. The Koch Institute’s collaborative approach extends beyond its labs: principal investigators often form partnerships with colleagues at world-renowned medical centers, bridging the gap between discovery and clinical impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="801031442" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{59}"&gt;Current Koch Institute Director Matthew Vander Heiden, also a practicing oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, is driven by patient stories.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="8" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{65}"&gt;“It is never lost on us that the work we do in the lab is important to change the reality of cancer for patients,” he says. “We are constantly motivated by the urgent need to translate our research and improve outcomes for those impacted by cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" paraid="9" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{75}"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symbols of progress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="10" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{81}"&gt;The items on display as part of Object Lessons take viewers on a journey through five decades of MIT cancer research, from the pioneering days of Salvador Luria, founding director of the Center for Cancer Research, to some of the Koch Institute’s newest investigators, including Francisco Sánchez-Rivera, the Eisen and Chang Career Development Professor and an assistant professor of biology, and Jessica Stark, the Underwood-Prescott Career Development Professor and an assistant professor of biological engineering and chemical engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="11" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{103}"&gt;Among the standout pieces is a humble yet iconic object: Salvador Luria’s ceramic mug, emblazoned with “Luria’s broth.” Lysogeny broth, often called — apocryphally — Luria Broth, is a medium for growing bacteria. Still in use today, the recipe was first published in 1951 by a research associate in Luria’s lab. The artifact, on loan from the MIT Museum, symbolizes the foundational years of the Center for Cancer Research and serves as a reminder of Luria’s influence as an early visionary. His work set the stage for a new era of biological inquiry that would shape cancer research at MIT for generations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="12" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{147}"&gt;Visitors can explore firsthand how the Koch Institute continues to build on the legacy of its predecessors, translating decades of knowledge into new tools and therapies that have the potential to transform patient care and cancer research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1754580287" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{153}"&gt;For instance, the PCR machine designed in the Horvitz Lab in the 1980s made genetic manipulation of cells easier, and gene sequencing faster and more cost-effective. At the time of its commercialization, this groundbreaking benchtop unit marked a major leap forward. In the decades since, technological advances have allowed for the visualization of DNA and biological processes at a much smaller scale, as demonstrated by the handheld BioBits imaging device developed by Stark and on display next door to the Horvitz panel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p xml:lang="EN-US" paraid="2026162156" paraeid="{3cd7ccfb-26ff-41d9-91eb-99186b733e57}{205}" lang="EN-US"&gt;“We created BioBits kits to address a need for increased equity in STEM education,” Stark says. “By making hands-on biology education approachable and affordable, BioBits kits are helping inspire and empower the next generation of scientists."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="595247363" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{201}"&gt;While the exhibition showcases scientific discoveries and marvels of engineering, it also aims to underscore the human element of cancer research through personally significant items, such as a messenger bag and Seq-Well device belonging to Alex Shalek, J. W. Kieckhefer Professor in the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science and the Department of Chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="15" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{223}"&gt;Shalek&amp;nbsp;investigates the molecular differences between individual cells, developing mobile RNA-sequencing devices. He could often be seen toting the bag around the Boston area and worldwide as he perfected and shared his technology with collaborators near and far. Through his work, Shalek has helped to make single-cell sequencing accessible for labs in more than 30 countries across six continents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="16" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{251}"&gt;“The KI seamlessly brings together students, staff, clinicians, and faculty across multiple different disciplines to collaboratively derive transformative insights into cancer,” Shalek says. “To me, these sorts of partnerships are the best part about being at MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="17" paraeid="{324e93ce-641e-465b-8e7b-790273263246}{2}"&gt;Around the corner from Shalek’s display, visitors will find an object that serves as a stark reminder of the real people impacted by Koch Institute research: Steven Keating’s SM ’12, PhD ’16 3D-printed model of his own brain tumor. Keating, who passed away in 2019, became a fierce advocate for the rights of patients to their medical data, and came to know Vander Heiden through his pursuit to become an expert on his tumor type, IDH-mutant glioma. In the years since, Vander Heiden’s work has contributed to a new therapy to treat Keating’s tumor type. In 2024, the drug, called vorasidenib, gained FDA approval, providing the first therapeutic breakthrough for Keating’s cancer in more than 20 years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="18" paraeid="{324e93ce-641e-465b-8e7b-790273263246}{36}"&gt;As the Koch Institute looks to the future, Object Lessons stands as a celebration of the people, the science, and the culture that have defined MIT’s first half-century of breakthroughs and contributions to the field of cancer research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="19" paraeid="{324e93ce-641e-465b-8e7b-790273263246}{42}"&gt;“Working in the uniquely collaborative environment of the Koch Institute and MIT, I am confident that we will continue to unlock key insights in the fight against cancer,” says Vander Heiden. “Our community is poised to embark on our next 50 years with the same passion and innovation that has carried us this far.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="582443480" paraeid="{324e93ce-641e-465b-8e7b-790273263246}{52}"&gt;Object Lessons is on view in the Koch Institute Public Galleries Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., through spring semester 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT-affiliated winners of the 2024 Nobel Prizes were celebrated in Stockholm, Sweden, as part of Nobel Week, which culminated with a grand &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-A4dUowT4Q" target="_blank"&gt;Nobel ceremony on Dec. 10&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s laureates with MIT ties include Daron Acemoglu, an Institute Professor, and Simon Johnson, the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship, who together &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/mit-economists-daron-acemoglu-simon-johnson-nobel-prize-economics-1014"&gt;shared the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel&lt;/a&gt;, along with James Robinson of the University of Chicago, for their work on the relationship between economic growth and political institutions. MIT Department of Biology alumnus Victor Ambros ’75, PhD ’79 also shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Gary Ruvkun, who completed his postdoctoral research at the Institute alongside Ambros in the 1980s. The two were &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/victor-ambros-gary-ruvkun-share-nobel-prize-physiology-medicine-1007"&gt;honored for their discovery of MicroRNA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The honorees and their invited guests took part in a number of activities in Stockholm during this year’s Nobel Week, which began Dec. 5 with press conferences and a tour of special Nobel Week Lights around the city. Lectures, a visit to the Nobel Prize Museum, and a concert followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per tradition, the winners received their medals from King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel. (Winners of the Nobel Peace Prize were honored on the same day in Oslo, Norway.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 105 MIT affiliates — including faculty, staff, alumni, and others — have won Nobel Prizes, according to MIT Institutional Research. Photos from the festivities appear below.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metabolic imaging is a noninvasive method that enables clinicians and scientists to study living cells using laser light, which can help them assess disease progression and treatment responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But light scatters when it shines into biological tissue, limiting how deep it can penetrate and hampering the resolution of captured images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, MIT researchers have developed a new technique that more than doubles the usual depth limit of metabolic imaging. Their method also boosts imaging speeds, yielding richer and more detailed images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new technique does not require tissue to be preprocessed, such as by cutting it or staining it with dyes. Instead, a specialized laser illuminates deep into the tissue, causing certain intrinsic molecules within the cells and tissues to emit light. This eliminates the need to alter the tissue, providing a more natural and accurate representation of its structure and function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers achieved this by adaptively customizing the laser light for deep tissues. Using a recently developed fiber shaper — a device they control by bending it — they can tune the color and pulses of light to minimize scattering and maximize the signal as the light travels deeper into the tissue. This allows them to see much further into living tissue and capture clearer images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="/sites/default/files/images/inline/deep-imaging.gif" data-align="center" data-entity-uuid="73748458-89de-4fd6-8437-bdafec2eb5dd" data-entity-type="file" alt="Animation shows a spinning, web-like object with a white wall bisecting it.

The clearer side is the result of the researchers’ new imaging method, in combination with their previous work on physics-based deblurring.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Credit: Courtesy of the researchers&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greater penetration depth, faster speeds, and higher resolution make this method particularly well-suited for demanding imaging applications like cancer research, tissue engineering, drug discovery, and the study of immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work shows a significant improvement in terms of depth penetration for label-free metabolic imaging. It opens new avenues for studying and exploring metabolic dynamics deep in living biosystems,” says Sixian You, assistant professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), a member of the Research Laboratory for Electronics, and senior author of a paper on this imaging technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is joined on the paper by lead author Kunzan Liu, an EECS graduate student; Tong Qiu, an MIT postdoc; Honghao Cao, an EECS graduate student; Fan Wang, professor of brain and cognitive sciences; Roger Kamm, the Cecil and Ida Green Distinguished Professor of Biological and Mechanical Engineering; Linda Griffith, the School of Engineering Professor of Teaching Innovation in the Department of Biological Engineering; and other MIT colleagues. The research &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adp2438" target="_blank"&gt;appears today in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laser-focused&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new method falls in the category of label-free imaging, which means tissue is not stained beforehand. Staining creates contrast that helps a clinical biologist see cell nuclei and proteins better. But staining typically requires the biologist to section and slice the sample, a process that often kills the tissue and makes it impossible to study dynamic processes in living cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In label-free imaging techniques, researchers use lasers to illuminate specific molecules within cells, causing them to emit light of different colors that reveal various molecular contents and cellular structures. However, generating the ideal laser light with certain wavelengths and high-quality pulses for deep-tissue imaging has been challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers developed a new approach to overcome this limitation. They use a multimode fiber, a type of optical fiber which can carry a significant amount of power, and couple it with a compact device called a “fiber shaper.” This shaper allows them to precisely modulate the light propagation by adaptively changing the shape of the fiber. Bending the fiber changes the color and intensity of the laser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46244-5" target="_blank"&gt;prior work&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers adapted the first version of the fiber shaper for deeper multimodal metabolic imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to channel all this energy into the colors we need with the pulse properties we require. This gives us higher generation efficiency and a clearer image, even deep within tissues,” says Cao.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once they had built the controllable mechanism, they developed an imaging platform to leverage the powerful laser source to generate longer wavelengths of light, which are crucial for deeper penetration into biological tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe this technology has the potential to significantly advance biological research. By making it affordable and accessible to biology labs, we hope to empower scientists with a powerful tool for discovery,” Liu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers tested their imaging device, the light was able to penetrate more than 700 micrometers into a biological sample, whereas the best prior techniques could only reach about 200 micrometers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With this new type of deep imaging, we want to look at biological samples and see something we have never seen before,” Liu adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deep imaging technique enabled them to see cells at multiple levels within a living system, which could help researchers study metabolic changes that happen at different depths. In addition, the faster imaging speed allows them to gather more detailed information on how a cell’s metabolism affects the speed and direction of its movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new imaging method could offer a boost to the study of organoids, which are engineered cells that can grow to mimic the structure and function of organs. Researchers in the Kamm and Griffith labs pioneer the development of brain and endometrial organoids that can grow like organs for disease and treatment assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it has been challenging to precisely observe internal developments without cutting or staining the tissue, which kills the sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new imaging technique allows researchers to noninvasively monitor the metabolic states inside a living organoid while it continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these and other biomedical applications in mind, the researchers plan to aim for even higher-resolution images. At the same time, they are working to create low-noise laser sources, which could enable deeper imaging with less light dosage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are also developing algorithms that react to the images to reconstruct the full 3D structures of biological samples in high resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the long run, they hope to apply this technique in the real world to help biologists monitor drug response in real-time to aid in the development of new medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By enabling multimodal metabolic imaging that reaches deeper into tissues, we’re providing scientists with an unprecedented ability to observe nontransparent biological systems in their natural state. We’re excited to collaborate with clinicians, biologists, and bioengineers to push the boundaries of this technology and turn these insights into real-world medical breakthroughs,” You says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work is exciting because it uses innovative feedback methods to image cell metabolism deeper in tissues compared to current techniques. These technologies also provide fast imaging speeds, which was used to uncover unique metabolic dynamics of immune cell motility within blood vessels. I expect that these imaging tools will be instrumental for discovering links between cell function and metabolism within dynamic living systems,” says Melissa Skala, an investigator at the Morgridge Institute for Research who was not involved with this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being able to acquire high resolution multi-photon images relying on NAD(P)H autofluorescence contrast faster and deeper into tissues opens the door to the study of a wide range of important problems,” adds Irene Georgakoudi, a professor of biomedical engineering at Tufts University who was also not involved with this work. “Imaging living tissues as fast as possible whenever you assess metabolic function is always a huge advantage in terms of ensuring the physiological relevance of the data, sampling a meaningful tissue volume, or monitoring fast changes. For applications in cancer diagnosis or in neuroscience, imaging deeper — and faster — enables us to consider a richer set of problems and interactions that haven’t been studied in living tissues before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is funded, in part, by MIT startup funds, a U.S. National Science Foundation CAREER Award, an MIT Irwin Jacobs and Joan Klein Presidential Fellowship, and an MIT Kailath Fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chronic diseases like Type 2 diabetes and inflammatory disorders have a huge impact on humanity. They are a leading cause of disease burden and deaths around the globe, are physically and economically taxing, and the number of people with such diseases is growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating chronic disease has proven difficult because there is not one simple cause, like a single gene mutation, that a treatment could target. At least, that’s how it has appeared to scientists. However, new research from MIT professor of biology and Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research member Richard Young and colleagues, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.10.051"&gt;published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt; on Nov. 27&lt;/a&gt;, reveals that many chronic diseases have a common denominator that could be driving their dysfunction: reduced protein mobility.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What this means is that around half of all proteins active in cells slow their movement when cells are in a chronic disease state, reducing the proteins’ functions. The researchers’ findings suggest that protein mobility may be a linchpin for decreased cellular function in chronic disease, making it a promising therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their paper, Young and colleagues in his lab, including MIT postdoc Alessandra Dall’Agnese, graduate students Shannon Moreno and Ming Zheng, and Research Scientist Tong Ihn Lee, describe their discovery of this common mobility defect, which they call proteolethargy; explain what causes the defect and how it leads to dysfunction in cells; and propose a new therapeutic hypothesis for treating chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m excited about what this work could mean for patients,” says Dall’Agnese. “My hope is that this will lead to a new class of drugs that restore protein mobility, which could help people with many different diseases that all have this mechanism as a common denominator.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work was a collaborative, interdisciplinary effort that brought together biologists, physicists, chemists, computer scientists and physician-scientists,” Lee says. “Combining that expertise is a strength of the Young lab. Studying the problem from different viewpoints really helped us think about how this mechanism might work and how it could change our understanding of the pathology of chronic disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commuter delays cause work stoppages in the cell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do proteins moving more slowly through a cell lead to widespread and significant cellular dysfunction? Dall’Agnese explains that every cell is like a tiny city, with proteins as the workers who keep everything running. Proteins have to commute in dense traffic in the cell, traveling from where they are created to where they work. The faster their commute, the more work they get done. Now, imagine a city that starts experiencing traffic jams along all the roads. Stores don’t open on time, groceries are stuck in transit, meetings are postponed. Essentially all operations in the city are slowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The slowdown of operations in cells experiencing reduced protein mobility follows a similar progression. Normally, most proteins zip around the cell bumping into other molecules until they locate the molecule they work with or act on. The slower a protein moves, the fewer other molecules it will reach, and so the less likely it will be able to do its job. Young and colleagues found that such protein slowdowns lead to measurable reductions in the functional output of the proteins. When many proteins fail to get their jobs done in time, cells begin to experience a variety of problems — as they are known to do in chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discovering the protein mobility problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young and colleagues first suspected that cells affected in chronic disease might have a protein mobility problem after observing changes in the behavior of the insulin receptor, a signaling protein that reacts to the presence of insulin and causes cells to take in sugar from blood. In people with diabetes, cells become less responsive to insulin — a state called insulin resistance — causing too much sugar to remain in the blood. In research&lt;a href="https://wi.mit.edu/news/new-understanding-diabetes"&gt;&amp;nbsp;published on insulin receptors&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;in 2022, Young and colleagues reported that insulin receptor mobility might be relevant to diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing that many cellular functions are altered in diabetes, the researchers considered the possibility that altered protein mobility might somehow affect many proteins in cells. To test this hypothesis, they studied proteins involved in a broad range of cellular functions, including MED1, a protein involved in gene expression; HP1α, a protein involved in gene silencing; FIB1, a protein involved in production of ribosomes; and SRSF2, a protein involved in splicing of messenger RNA. They used single-molecule tracking and other methods to measure how each of those proteins moves in healthy cells and in cells in disease states. All but one of the proteins showed reduced mobility (about 20-35 percent) in the disease cells.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m excited that we were able to transfer physics-based insight and methodology, which are commonly used to understand the single-molecule processes like gene transcription in normal cells, to a disease context and show that they can be used to uncover unexpected mechanisms of disease,” Zheng says. “This work shows how the random walk of proteins in cells is linked to disease pathology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreno concurs: “In school, we’re taught to consider changes in protein structure or DNA sequences when looking for causes of disease, but we’ve demonstrated that those are not the only contributing factors. If you only consider a static picture of a protein or a cell, you miss out on discovering these changes that only appear when molecules are in motion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can’t commute across the cell, I’m all tied up right now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers needed to determine what was causing the proteins to slow down. They suspected that the defect had to do with an increase in cells of the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), molecules that are highly prone to interfering with other molecules and their chemical reactions. Many types of chronic-disease-associated triggers, such as higher sugar or fat levels, certain toxins, and inflammatory signals, lead to an increase in ROS, also known as an increase in oxidative stress. The researchers measured the mobility of the proteins again, in cells that had high levels of ROS and were not otherwise in a disease state, and saw comparable mobility defects, suggesting that oxidative stress was to blame for the protein mobility defect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final part of the puzzle was why some, but not all, proteins slow down in the presence of ROS. SRSF2 was the only one of the proteins that was unaffected in the experiments, and it had one clear difference from the others: its surface did not contain any cysteines, an amino acid building block of many proteins. Cysteines are especially susceptible to interference from ROS because it will cause them to bond to other cysteines. When this bonding occurs between two protein molecules, it slows them down because the two proteins cannot move through the cell as quickly as either protein alone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half of the proteins in our cells contain surface cysteines, so this single protein mobility defect can impact many different cellular pathways. This makes sense when one considers the diversity of dysfunctions that appear in cells of people with chronic diseases: dysfunctions in cell signaling, metabolic processes, gene expression and gene silencing, and more. All of these processes rely on the efficient functioning of proteins — including the diverse proteins studied by the researchers. Young and colleagues performed several experiments to confirm that decreased protein mobility does in fact decrease a protein’s function. For example, they found that when an insulin receptor experiences decreased mobility, it acts less efficiently on IRS1, a molecule to which it usually adds a phosphate group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From understanding a mechanism to treating a disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discovering that decreased protein mobility in the presence of oxidative stress could be driving many of the symptoms of chronic disease provides opportunities to develop therapies to rescue protein mobility. In the course of their experiments, the researchers treated cells with an antioxidant drug — something that reduces ROS — called N-acetyl cysteine and saw that this partially restored protein mobility.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are pursuing a variety of follow-ups to this work, including the search for drugs that safely and efficiently reduce ROS and restore protein mobility. They developed an assay that can be used to screen drugs to see if they restore protein mobility by comparing each drug’s effect on a simple biomarker with surface cysteines to one without. They are also looking into other diseases that may involve protein mobility, and are exploring the role of reduced protein mobility in aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The complex biology of chronic diseases has made it challenging to come up with effective therapeutic hypotheses,” says Young. “The discovery that diverse disease-associated stimuli all induce a common feature, proteolethargy, and that this feature could contribute to much of the dysregulation that we see in chronic disease, is something that I hope will be a real game-changer for developing drugs that work across the spectrum of chronic diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>Anne Trafton | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At&amp;nbsp;MIT, collaboration between researchers working in the life sciences and engineering is a frequent occurrence. Under a new initiative launched last week, the Institute plans to strengthen and expand those collaborations to take on some of the most pressing health challenges facing the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new MIT Health and Life Sciences Collaborative, or MIT HEALS, will bring together researchers from all over the Institute to find new solutions to challenges in health care. HEALS will draw on MIT’s strengths in life sciences and other fields, including artificial intelligence and chemical and biological engineering, to accelerate progress in improving patient care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a source of new knowledge, of new tools and new cures, and of the innovators and the innovations that will shape the future of biomedicine and health care, there is just no place like MIT,” MIT President Sally&amp;nbsp;Kornbluth said at a launch event last Wednesday in Kresge Auditorium. “Our goal with MIT HEALS is to&amp;nbsp;help inspire, accelerate, and deliver solutions, at scale, to some of society’s most urgent and intractable health challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch event served as a day-long review of MIT’s historical impact in the life sciences and a preview of what it hopes to accomplish in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The talent assembled here has produced some truly towering accomplishments. But also — and, I believe, more importantly — you represent a deep well of creative potential for even greater impact,” Kornbluth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey, who addressed the filled auditorium, spoke of her excitement about the new initiative, emphasizing that “MIT’s leadership and the work that you do are more important than ever.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of things as governor that I really appreciate is the opportunity to see so many of our state’s accomplished scientists and bright minds come together, work together, and forge a new commitment to improving human life,” Healey said. “It’s even more exciting when you think about this convening to think about all the amazing cures and treatments and discoveries that will result from it. I’m proud to say, and I really believe this, this is something that could only happen in Massachusetts. There’s no place that has the ecosystem that we have here, and we must fight hard to always protect that and to nurture that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A history of impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT has a long history of pioneering new fields in the life sciences, as MIT Institute Professor Phillip Sharp noted in his keynote address. Fifty years ago, MIT’s Center for Cancer Research was born, headed by Salvador Luria, a molecular biologist and a 1975 Nobel laureate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That center helped to lead the revolutions in molecular biology, and later recombinant DNA technology, which have had significant impacts on human health. Research by MIT Professor Robert Weinberg and others identifying cancer genes has led the development of targeted drugs for cancer, including Herceptin and Gleevec.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, the Center for Cancer Research evolved into the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, whose faculty members are divided evenly between the School of Science and the School of Engineering, and where interdisciplinary collaboration is now the norm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While MIT has long been a pioneer in this kind of collaborative health research, over the past several years, MIT’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://corporation.mit.edu/committees/visiting-committees/"&gt;visiting committees&lt;/a&gt; reported that there was potential to further enhance those collaborations, according to Nergis Mavalvala, dean of MIT’s School of Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the very strong themes that emerged was that there’s an enormous hunger among our colleagues to collaborate more. And not just within their disciplines and within their departments, but across departmental boundaries, across school boundaries, and even with the hospitals and the biotech sector,” Mavalvala told &lt;em&gt;MIT News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore whether MIT could be doing more to encourage interdisciplinary research in the life sciences, Mavalvala and Anantha Chandrakasan, dean of the School of Engineering and MIT’s chief innovation and strategy officer,&amp;nbsp;appointed a faculty committee called VITALS (Vision to Integrate, Translate and Advance Life Sciences).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That committee was co-chaired by Tyler Jacks, the David H. Koch Professor of Biology at MIT and a member and former director of the Koch Institute, and Kristala Jones Prather, head of MIT’s Department of Chemical Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We surveyed the faculty, and for many people, the sense was that they could do more if there were improved mechanisms for interaction and collaboration. Not that those don’t exist — everybody knows that we have a highly collaborative environment at MIT, but that we could do even more if we had some additional infrastructure in place to facilitate bringing people together, and perhaps providing funding to initiate collaborative projects,” Jacks said before last week’s launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These efforts will build on and expand existing collaborative structures. MIT is already home to a number of institutes that promote collaboration across disciplines, including not only the Koch Institute but also the McGovern Institute for Brain Research, the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, and the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have some great examples of crosscutting work around MIT, but there's still more opportunity to bring together faculty and researchers across the Institute,” Chandrakasan said before the launch event. “While there are these great individual pieces, we can amplify those while creating new collaborations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supporting science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her opening remarks on Wednesday, Kornbluth announced several new programs designed to support researchers in the life sciences and help promote connections between faculty at MIT, surrounding institutions and hospitals, and companies in the Kendall Square area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A crucial part of MIT HEALS will be finding ways to support, mentor, connect, and foster community for the very best minds, at every stage of their careers,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With funding provided by Noubar Afeyan PhD ’87, an executive member of the MIT Corporation and founder and CEO of Flagship Pioneering, MIT HEALS will offer fellowships for graduate students interested in exploring new directions in the life sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key component of MIT HEALS will be the new Hood Pediatric Innovation Hub, which will focus on development of medical treatments specifically for children. This program, established with a gift from the Charles H. Hood Foundation, will be led by Elazer Edelman, a cardiologist and the Edward J. Poitras Professor in Medical Engineering and Science at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Currently, the major market incentives are for medical innovations intended for adults — because that’s where the money is. As a result, children are all too often treated with medical devices and therapies that don’t meet their needs, because they’re simply scaled-down versions of the adult models,” Kornbluth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As another tool to help promising research projects get off the ground, MIT HEALS will include a grant program known as the MIT-MGB Seed Program. This program, which will fund joint research projects between MIT and Massachusetts General Hospital/Brigham and Women’s Hospital, is being launched with support from Analog Devices, to establish the Analog Devices, Inc. Fund for Health and Life Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Biswas Family Foundation is providing funding for postdoctoral fellows, who will receive four-year appointments to pursue collaborative health sciences research. The details of the fellows program will be announced in spring 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the things we have learned through experience is that when we do collaborative work that is cross-disciplinary, the people who are actually crossing disciplinary boundaries and going into multiple labs are students and postdocs,” Mavalvala said prior to the launch event. “The trainees, the younger generation, are much more nimble, moving between labs, learning new techniques and integrating new ideas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revolutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussions following the release of the VITALS committee report identified seven potential research areas where new research could have a big impact: AI and life science, low-cost diagnostics, neuroscience and mental health, environmental life science, food and agriculture, the future of public health and health care, and women’s health. However, Chandrakasan noted that research within HEALS will not be limited to those topics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want this to be a very bottom-up process,” he told &lt;em&gt;MIT News&lt;/em&gt;. “While there will be a few areas like AI and life sciences that we will absolutely prioritize, there will be plenty of room for us to be surprised on those innovative, forward-looking directions, and we hope to be surprised.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the launch event, faculty members from departments across MIT shared their work during panels that focused on the biosphere, brains, health care, immunology, entrepreneurship, artificial intelligence, translation, and collaboration. In addition, a poster session &lt;a href="https://science.mit.edu/mit-heals-launch-poster-session/" target="_blank"&gt;highlighted over 100 research projects&lt;/a&gt; in areas such as diagnostics, women’s health, neuroscience, mental health, and more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program, which was developed by Amy Keating, head of the Department of Biology, and Katharina Ribbeck, the Andrew and Erna Viterbi Professor of Biological Engineering, also included a spoken-word performance by Victory Yinka-Banjo, an MIT senior majoring in computer science and molecular biology. In her performance, called “Systems,” Yinka-Banjo urged the audience to “zoom out,” look at systems in their entirety, and pursue collective action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To be at MIT is to contribute to an era of infinite impact. It is to look beyond the microscope, zooming out to embrace the grander scope. To be at MIT is to latch onto hope so that in spite of a global pandemic, we fight and we cope. We fight with science and policy across clinics, academia, and industry for the betterment of our planet, for our rights, for our health,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a panel titled “Revolutions,” Douglas Lauffenburger, the Ford Professor of Engineering and one of the founders of MIT’s Department of Biological Engineering, noted that engineers have been innovating in medicine since the 1950s, producing critical advances such as kidney dialysis, prosthetic limbs, and sophisticated medical imaging techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT launched its program in biological engineering in 1998, and it became a full-fledged department in 2005. The department was founded based on the concept of developing new approaches to studying biology and developing potential treatments based on the new advances being made in molecular biology and genomics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those two revolutions laid the foundation for a brand new kind of engineering that was not possible before them,” Lauffenburger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that panel, Jacks and Ruth Lehmann, director of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, outlined several interdisciplinary projects underway at the Koch Institute and the Whitehead Institute. Those projects include using AI to analyze mammogram images and detect cancer earlier, engineering drought-resistant plants, and using CRISPR to identify genes involved in&amp;nbsp;toxoplasmosis infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These examples illustrate the potential impact that can occur when “basic science meets translational science,” Lehmann said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m really looking forward to HEALS further enlarging the interactions that we have, and I think the possibilities for science, both at a mechanistic level and understanding the complexities of health and the planet, are really great,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The importance of teamwork&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To bring together faculty and students with common interests and help spur new collaborations, HEALS plans to host workshops on different health-related topics. A faculty committee is now searching for a director for HEALS, who will coordinate these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important goal of the HEALS initiative, which was the focus of the day’s final panel discussion, is enhancing partnerships with Boston-area hospitals and biotech companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are many, many different forms of collaboration,” said Anne Klibanski, president and CEO of Mass General Brigham. “Part of it is the people. You bring the people together. Part of it is the ideas. But I have found certainly in our system, the way to get the best and the brightest people working together is to give them a problem to solve. You give them a problem to solve, and that’s where you get the energy, the passion, and the talent working together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Langer, the David H. Koch Institute Professor at MIT and a member of the Koch Institute, noted the importance of tackling fundamental challenges without knowing exactly where they will lead. Langer, trained as a chemical engineer, began working in biomedical research in the 1970s, when most of his engineering classmates were going into jobs in the oil industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, he worked with Judah Folkman at Boston Children’s Hospital on the idea of developing drugs that would starve tumors by cutting off their blood supply. “It took many, many years before those would [reach patients],” he says. “It took Genentech doing great work, building on some of the things we did that would lead to Avastin and many other drugs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Langer has spent much of his career developing novel strategies for delivering molecules, including messenger RNA, into cells. In 2010, he and Afeyan co-founded Moderna to further develop mRNA technology, which was eventually incorporated into mRNA vaccines for Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The important thing is to try to figure out what the applications are, which is a team effort,” Langer said. “Certainly when we published those papers in 1976, we had obviously no idea that messenger RNA would be important, that Covid would even exist. And so really it ends up being a team effort over the years.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>An inflatable gastric balloon could help people lose weight</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gastric balloons — silicone balloons filled with air or saline and placed in the stomach — can help people lose weight by making them feel too full to overeat. However, this effect eventually can wear off as the stomach becomes used to the sensation of fullness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome that limitation, MIT engineers have designed a new type of gastric balloon that can be inflated and deflated as needed. In an animal study, they showed that inflating the balloon before a meal caused the animals to reduce their food intake by 60 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This type of intervention could offer an alternative for people who don’t want to undergo more invasive treatments such as gastric bypass surgery, or people who don’t respond well to weight-loss drugs, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The basic concept is we can have this balloon that is dynamic, so it would be inflated right before a meal and then you wouldn’t feel hungry. Then it would be deflated in between meals,” says Giovanni Traverso, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT, a gastroenterologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and the senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neil Zixun Jia, who received a PhD from MIT in 2023, is the lead author of the paper, which &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.device.2024.100624" target="_blank"&gt;appears today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Device&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An inflatable balloon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gastric balloons filled with saline are currently approved for use in the United States. These balloons stimulate a sense of fullness in the stomach, and studies have shown that they work well, but the benefits are often temporary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Gastric balloons do work initially. Historically, what has been seen is that the balloon is associated with weight loss. But then in general, the weight gain resumes the same trajectory,” Traverso says. “What we reasoned was perhaps if we had a system that simulates that fullness in a transient way, meaning right before a meal, that could be a way of inducing weight loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve a longer-lasting effect in patients, the researchers set out to design a device that could expand and contract on demand. They created two prototypes: One is a traditional balloon that inflates and deflates, and the other is a mechanical device with four arms that expand outward, pushing out an elastic polymer shell that presses on the stomach wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In animal tests,&amp;nbsp;the researchers found that the mechanical-arm device could effectively expand to fill the stomach, but they ended up deciding to pursue the balloon option instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our sense was that the balloon probably distributed the force better, and down the line, if you have balloon that is applying the pressure, that is probably a safer approach in the long run,” Traverso says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ new balloon is similar to a traditional gastric balloon, but it is inserted into the stomach through an incision in the abdominal wall. The balloon is connected to an external controller that can be attached to the skin and contains a pump that inflates and deflates the balloon when needed. Inserting this device would be similar to the procedure used to place a feeding tube into a patient’s stomach, which is commonly done for people who are unable to eat or drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If people, for example, are unable to swallow, they receive food through a tube like this. We know that we can keep tubes in for years, so there is already precedent for other systems that can stay in the body for a very long time. That gives us some confidence in the longer-term compatibility of this system,” Traverso says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced food intake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In tests in animals, the researchers found that inflating the balloon before meals led to a 60 percent reduction in the amount of food consumed. These studies were done over the course of a month, but the researchers now plan to do longer-term studies to see if this reduction leads to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The deployment for traditional gastric balloons is usually six months, if not more, and only then you will see good amount of weight loss. We will have to evaluate our device in a similar or longer time span to prove it really works better,” Jia says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If developed for use in humans, the new gastric balloon could offer an alternative to existing obesity treatments. Other treatments for obesity include gastric bypass surgery, “stomach stapling” (a surgical procedure in which the stomach capacity is reduced), and drugs including GLP-1 receptor agonists such as semaglutide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gastric balloon could be an option for patients who are not good candidates for surgery or don’t respond well to weight-loss drugs, Traverso says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For certain patients who are higher-risk, who cannot undergo surgery, or did not tolerate the medication or had some other contraindication, there are limited options,” he says. “Traditional gastric balloons are still being used, but they come with a caveat that eventually the weight loss can plateau, so this is a way of trying to address that fundamental limitation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering, the Karl van Tassel Career Development Professorship, the Whitaker Health Sciences Fund Fellowship, the T.S. Lin Fellowship, the MIT Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program, and the Boston University Yawkey Funded Internship Program.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The factors impacting successful patient care are many and varied. Early diagnosis, proper adherence to prescription medication schedules, and effective monitoring and management of chronic disease, for example, all contribute to better outcomes. However, each of these factors can be hindered by outside influences — medication doesn’t work as well if it isn’t taken as prescribed, and disease can be missed or misdiagnosed in early stages if symptoms are mild or not present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giovanni Traverso, the Karl Van Tassel Career Development Professor, an associate professor of mechanical engineering, and a gastroenterologist in the Division of Gastroenterology, Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), is working on a variety of innovative solutions to improve patient care. As a physician and an engineer, he brings a unique perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bringing those two domains together is what really can help transform and accelerate our capacity to develop new biomedical devices or new therapies for a range of conditions,” he says. “As physicians, we're extremely fortunate to be able to help individuals. As scientists and engineers, not only can we help individuals … we can help populations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traverso found a passion for this work early in life. His family lived in his father’s native Peru through much of his childhood, but left in the late 1980s at the height of the nation’s political instability, emigrating to Canada, where he began high school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In high school, I had the incredible opportunity to actually spend time in a lab,” he says. “I really fell in love with molecular genetics. I loved the lab environment and that ability to investigate a very specific problem, with the hopes that those developments would eventually help people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He started medical school immediately after high school, attending the University of Cambridge, but paused his medical training to pursue a PhD in medical sciences at Johns Hopkins University before returning to Cambridge. After completing medical school, he completed internal medicine residency at BWH and his gastroenterology fellowship training at Massachusetts General Hospital, both at Harvard Medical School. For his postdoctoral research, he transitioned to the fields of chemical and biomedical engineering in the laboratory of Professor Robert Langer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traverso’s research interests today include biomedical device development, ingestible and implantable robotics, and drug delivery for optimal drug adherence. His academic home at MIT is in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, but his work integrates multiple domains, including mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, material science, and synthetic biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The mechanical engineering department is a tremendous place to engage with students, as well as faculty, towards the development of the next generation of medical devices,” he says. “At the core of many of those medical devices are fundamental mechanical principles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traverso’s team in the &lt;a href="http://www.l4te.org/"&gt;Laboratory for Translational Engineering&lt;/a&gt; is developing pioneering biomedical devices such as drug delivery systems to enable safe, efficient delivery of therapeutics, and novel diagnostic tests to support early detection of diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heart of his work, he says, is “about trying to help others. Patients, of course, but also students, to help them see the arc of bench-to-bedside and help stimulate their interest in careers applying engineering to help improve human health.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;White House science advisor Arati Prabhakar expressed confidence in U.S. science and technology capacities during a talk on Wednesday about major issues the country must tackle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Let me start with the purpose of science and technology and innovation, which is to open possibilities so that we can achieve our great aspirations,” said Prabhakar, who is the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and a co-chair of the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The aspirations that we have as a country today are as great as they have ever been,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of Prabhakar’s talk focused on three major issues in science and technology development: cancer prevention, climate change, and AI. In the process, she also emphasized the necessity for the U.S. to sustain its global leadership in research across domains of science and technology, which she called “one of America’s long-time strengths.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ever since the end of the Second World War, we said we’re going in on basic research, we’re going to build our universities’ capacity to do it, we have an unparalleled basic research capacity, and we should always have that,” said Prabhakar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have gotten better, I think, in recent years at commercializing technology from our basic research,” Prabhakar added, noting, “Capital moves when you can see profit and growth.” The Biden administration, she said, has invested in a variety of new ways for the public and private sector to work together to massively accelerate the movement of technology into the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wednesday’s talk drew a capacity audience of nearly 300 people in MIT’s Wong Auditorium and was hosted by the Manufacturing@MIT Working Group. The event included introductory remarks by Suzanne Berger, an Institute Professor and a longtime expert on the innovation economy, and Nergis Mavalvala, dean of the School of Science and an astrophysicist and leader in gravitational-wave detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introducing Mavalvala, Berger said the 2015 announcement of the discovery of gravitational waves “was the day I felt proudest and most elated to be a member of the MIT community,” and noted that U.S. government support helped make the research possible. Mavalvala, in turn, said MIT was “especially honored” to hear Prabhakar discuss leading-edge research and acknowledge the role of universities in strengthening the country’s science and technology sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prabhakar has extensive experience in both government and the private sector. She has been OSTP director and co-chair of PCAST since October of 2022. She served as director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) from 2012 to 2017 and director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) from 1993 to 1997.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has also held executive positions at Raychem and Interval Research, and spent a decade at the investment firm U.S. Venture Partners. An engineer by training, Prabhakar earned a BS in electrical engineering from Texas Tech University in 1979, an MA in electrical engineering from Caltech in 1980, and a PhD in applied physics from Caltech in 1984.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other remarks about medicine, Prabhakar touted the Biden administration’s “Cancer Moonshot” program, which aims to cut the cancer death rate in half over the next 25 years through multiple approaches, from better health care provision and cancer detection to limiting public exposure to carcinogens. We should be striving, Prabhakar said, for “a future in which people take good health for granted and can get on with their lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On AI, she heralded both the promise and concerns about technology, saying, “I think it’s time for active steps to get on a path to where it actually allows people to do more and earn more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to climate change, Prabhakar said, “We all understand that the climate is going to change. But it’s in our hands how severe those changes get. And it’s possible that we can build a better future.” She noted the bipartisan infrastructure bill signed into law in 2021 and the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act as important steps forward in this fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Together those are making the single biggest investment anyone anywhere on the planet has ever made in the clean energy transition,” she said. “I used to feel hopeless about our ability to do that, and it gives me tremendous hope.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After her talk, Prabhakar was joined onstage for a group discussion with the three co-presidents of the MIT Energy and Climate Club: Laurentiu Anton, a doctoral candidate in electrical engineering and computer science; Rosie Keller, an MBA candidate at the MIT Sloan School of Management; and Thomas Lee, a doctoral candidate in MIT’s Institute for Data, Systems, and Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about the seemingly sagging public confidence in science today, Prabhakar offered a few thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The first thing I would say is, don’t take it personally,” Prabhakar said, noting that any dip in public regard for science is less severe than the diminished public confidence in other institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding some levity, she observed that in polling about which occupations are regarded as being desirable for a marriage partner to have, “scientist” still ranks highly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Scientists still do really well on that front, we’ve got that going for us,” she quipped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More seriously, Prabhakar observed, rather than “preaching” at the public, scientists should recognize that “part of the job for us is to continue to be clear about what we know are the facts, and to present them clearly but humbly, and to be clear that we’re going to continue working to learn more.” At the same time, she continued, scientists can always reinforce that “oh, by the way, facts are helpful things that can actually help you make better choices about how the future turns out. I think that would be better in my view.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prabhakar said that her White House work had been guided, in part, by one of the overarching themes that President Biden has often reinforced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He thinks about America as a nation that can be described in a single word, and that word is ‘possibilities,’” she said. “And that idea, that is such a big idea, it lights me up. I think of what we do in the world of science and technology and innovation as really part and parcel of creating those possibilities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Prabhakar said, at all times and all points in American history, scientists and technologists must continue “to prove once more that when people come together and do this work … we do it in a way that builds opportunity and expands opportunity for everyone in our country. I think this is the great privilege we all have in the work we do, and it’s also our responsibility.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
